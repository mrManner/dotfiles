2021-10-12 21:51:15	russ	Yes we could change the URL to use the member number, or add an alternate URL in case those links are used/bookmarked elsewhere. The participants api could also provide the user IDs... Maybe it already does as array keys?
2021-10-12 22:03:43	russ	Ah I see the participant list indexes by member number... Cleanest is probably to change the URL to use member numbers then - it's much more common than user ID in URLs.
2021-10-12 22:06:03	russ	Although that said... It seems a lot of the project/activity URLs do use user ID... For now maybe it's best just to add it as a value in the get/participants response for now
