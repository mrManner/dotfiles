2021-10-30 12:38:19	WhyNotHugo	There's experiments on porting kwin to use wlroots. I wonder if the KDE guys would want the blur feature on wlroots or kwin itself.
2021-10-30 12:39:01	WhyNotHugo	FWIW, I only want it for my status bar, which has the bg behind it (e.g.: not windows), so it might be a simpler route -- I wonder if the client can somehow impement it.
2021-10-30 12:43:24	tiosgz_	blur the background manually and set it to the client :P
2021-10-30 12:43:55	tiosgz_	or at first commit a fully transparent buffer and screenshot where you think it renders
2021-10-30 12:44:49	tiosgz_	both bad ideas, i know
2021-10-30 13:09:04	WhyNotHugo	Not a terrible idea, tbh. For a stats bar that doesn't move and has nothing behind it, it's good to reduce the amount of times the blur is computed.

2021-12-03 02:59:22	sunyibo	I'm using blueman-aplet. When it (dis)connects from a device, a gray message appears on the middle of the screen which then stays on the window without disappearing, rendering that window effectively useless. How can I get rid of that?
2021-12-03 05:33:26	Spawns_Carpeting	Hello. I was wondering about the best method to go about writing a status bar like swaybar. I have been meaning to try this for a while and never got around to doing it. Would it be a bad idea to just use GTK instead of using the wayland client functions directly?
2021-12-03 05:33:54	Spawns_Carpeting	i see swaybar uses wayland-client.h or whatever and pangocairo
2021-12-03 06:51:23	cheakoirccloud	https://www.quotes.net/mquote/4439 I had some problems onboarding and the guy in #foot was more interested in having new users experience problems than take any criticism.  Made me switch to alacritty even though I had to build it myself and later think of this quote and the recent LTT reports about Linux being a "developer only" tool.
2021-12-03 06:52:36	cheakoirccloud	If new sway users also need to be developers, then it's likely I'll join everyone else in using something else.
2021-12-03 06:59:41	cheakoirccloud	Spawns_Carpeting: I don't know anything about GUI application development I didn't learn in the 90s.  Just thinking about what you'd draw and can't see why you'd not render text mostly by hand...  None of the other controls or widgets would be much use in a bar and it's a lot of baggage for the one thing.  Just guessing though.
2021-12-03 07:02:01	cheakoirccloud	...I can say in Wayland images are mostly drawn by changing bytes in a file handle, likely memory mapped but that's not necessary, and sending that over to Wayland for drawing.
2021-12-03 07:03:49	cheakoirccloud	s/drawing/display
2021-12-03 07:08:58	Spawns_Carpeting	yeah that sounds right, once you get the basic functions setup to talk to wayland its really not that bad anyways
2021-12-03 07:09:17	Spawns_Carpeting	and drawing is going to be with pango/cairo in my case no matter what
2021-12-03 10:48:54	WhyNotHugo	I'd like to work on https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/5632, and I'm wondering if there's any feedback on which of the proposed solutions would be most acceptable.

2021-12-03 18:08:34	tsm	Hey all, I've got a usb hid device that supports high resolution scrolling. When I run `evtest` I see REL_WHEEL_HI_RES events, but it seems like all applications only see the REL_WHEEL events. I'm unsure if this is a sway issue or an application issue, but since it happens everywhere my guess is sway. I've tried changing `scroll_factor` in my config and it doesn't seem to have any effect.
2021-12-03 18:11:42	emersion	yeah it's not supported by wlroots
2021-12-03 18:11:50	emersion	there's a WIP pull request for it

2021-12-03 18:47:23	kraftwerk28	Is there a way to "freeze" the compositor while making a screenshot w/ grim? I find it useful, i.e. when a notification appears, it will likely disappear till I position a slurp rectangle on it
2021-12-03 18:52:03	legacyjames	kraftwerk28: I used grimshot with the area selection, and it appears to freeze the screen contents to draw a rectangle on what to capture.
2021-12-03 19:13:03	kraftwerk28	legacyjames, which command are you using? I use https://github.com/kraftwerk28/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/sway/config#L168, but the screen doesn't freeze.
2021-12-03 19:32:07	puffybuf	kraftwerk28: just take the whole screen and then edit it or grim that
2021-12-03 19:33:46	puffybuf	I use slurp combined with grim to take screenshot:
2021-12-03 19:33:58	puffybuf	slurp | grim -g - $(xdg-user-dir PICTURES)/$(date +'screenshot_%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S.png')
