2021-10-16 21:11:36	          	| Some kind of admin summary would definitely be good - the registration settings are a bit of a minefield, lots of flexibility but a bit confusing if you don't know what everything does. Could be a simple bullet list with yes/no green/red on what is possible and not possible with the current settings. I guess this could be a popup when saving, or a separate summary box (which updates live maybe) at the top/bottom of the page, or always in the sidebar for admins, etc...

Could be a simple bullet list with yes/no green/red on what is possible and not possible with the current settings.

Could be a simple bullet list with yes/no green/red on what is possible and not possible with the current settings.

2021-10-16 22:03:48	          	| No, it will only affect district/network/region/org counts because today they only include members in groups.
2021-10-16 22:03:48	          	| The only place these numbers are used today are on the org overview page, but the idea was that they could be sent to an external program, or used to build fancy trending graphs... Since we have been collecting this data, we have many GBs of historical statistics that are just waiting to be processed. Could make a graph of gender/age distribution over time for example, or the trend of paid/unpaid etc.

2021-10-20 21:55:49	          	| One thing to note - this will not work as expected for questions like "select a fee" or "pick a subproject" as they will be referencing fees/subprojects on the newly created project, not the parent one. This doesn't really fit your use-case anyway, but it's something to be aware of if someone wants to start putting those kinds of questions on the forms - then it's best to use the "group member question" form instead and link that - because those questions "live" on the target project, they are not copies.

2021-10-20 21:55:49	          	| Yeah I left it because it goes a bit deep with all the question sub-choices and stuff but I've fixed it now.
2021-10-20 21:55:49	          	| Also fixed copying choices (for things like dropdowns, radios, etc).
2021-10-20 21:55:49	          	| One thing to note - this will not work as expected for questions like "select a fee" or "pick a subproject" as they will be referencing fees/subprojects on the newly created project, not the parent one. This doesn't really fit your use-case anyway, but it's something to be aware of if someone wants to start putting those kinds of questions on the forms - then it's best to use the "group member question" form instead and link that - because those questions "live" on the target project, they are not copies.

2021-10-20 21:55:49	          	| One thing to note - this will not work as expected for questions like "select a fee" or "pick a subproject" as they will be referencing fees/subprojects on the newly created project, not the parent one. This doesn't really fit your use-case anyway, but it's something to be aware of if someone wants to start putting those kinds of questions on the forms - then it's best to use the "group member question" form instead and link that - because those questions "live" on the target project, they are not copies.

2021-10-20 21:55:49	          	| One thing to note - this will not work as expected for questions like "select a fee" or "pick a subproject" as they will be referencing fees/subprojects on the newly created project, not the parent one. This doesn't really fit your use-case anyway, but it's something to be aware of if someone wants to start putting those kinds of questions on the forms - then it's best to use the "group member question" form instead and link that - because those questions "live" on the target project, they are not copies.

2021-10-20 21:55:49	          	| One thing to note - this will not work as expected for questions like "select a fee" or "pick a subproject" as they will be referencing fees/subprojects on the newly created project, not the parent one. This doesn't really fit your use-case anyway, but it's something to be aware of if someone wants to start putting those kinds of questions on the forms - then it's best to use the "group member question" form instead and link that - because those questions "live" on the target project, they are not copies.

2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| Gonna be pretty light to be honest, so could be every 5 minutes if necessary - but we can see exactly how long it takes to create the files. I suspect it will be a matter of seconds, since there's nothing really complex going on.
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| More question:
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 3. In the user.csv file there is an auth column - I guess to specify how people can log in to the LMS system using this user data. What should we put here? "saml2" in the example is a kind of single sign on protocol but we don't support that (maybe you do via scout id)
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 4. Most of the files are semi-colon separated, but one is comma separated... Does it matter? Preference?

2021-11-30 14:38:34	          	| Apparently they update every 15 minutes.
2021-11-30 14:38:34	          	| 3. Yes we are using ScoutID it should be oauth2
2021-11-30 14:38:34	          	| 4. It says semi-colon i the Mapping instructions-file so I guess that is the right way.

2021-11-29 19:11:47	          	| 1. Should it be all members (15+) in every file? Restricted to main org I guess? Or just those with roles/group memberships/etc?

2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| Gonna be pretty light to be honest, so could be every 5 minutes if necessary - but we can see exactly how long it takes to create the files. I suspect it will be a matter of seconds, since there's nothing really complex going on.
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| More question:
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 3. In the user.csv file there is an auth column - I guess to specify how people can log in to the LMS system using this user data. What should we put here? "saml2" in the example is a kind of single sign on protocol but we don't support that (maybe you do via scout id)
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 4. Most of the files are semi-colon separated, but one is comma separated... Does it matter? Preference?

When this ticket is closed, we could compare the system’s numbers for 31/12/2020 with Ingrid’s numbers and investigate any discrepancies and we can see where we go from there.

2021-11-29 19:11:47	          	| 1. Should it be all members (15+) in every file? Restricted to main org I guess? Or just those with roles/group memberships/etc?
2021-11-29 19:11:47	          	| 2. Will they handle inactive/removed members by their absence in the file (related to point 1) - does this mean an accidental empty file upload deletes everyone? What are the consequences of that?

2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| Gonna be pretty light to be honest, so could be every 5 minutes if necessary - but we can see exactly how long it takes to create the files. I suspect it will be a matter of seconds, since there's nothing really complex going on.
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| More question:
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 3. In the user.csv file there is an auth column - I guess to specify how people can log in to the LMS system using this user data. What should we put here? "saml2" in the example is a kind of single sign on protocol but we don't support that (maybe you do via scout id)
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 4. Most of the files are semi-colon separated, but one is comma separated... Does it matter? Preference?

2021-11-30 14:38:34	          	| 3. Yes we are using ScoutID it should be oauth2
2021-11-30 14:38:34	          	| 4. It says semi-colon i the Mapping instructions-file so I guess that is the right way.

2021-12-01 18:40:57	          	| I would have modify the code to skip the current process and just set the new email address without storing it temporarily like it is now. Or is it the profile verified flag that is causing issues? If so maybe we can just stop using that globally anyway... That's not 100% the same as email verification.

2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| That's really annoying because it's normal with csv files to add quotes around strings with possible delimiters (spaces, commas, semi-colons, etc) like "Employment status" since some csv interpretations separate columns on spaces, and also it means that there's no confusion if a group name (for example) contains a comma or semi-colon, since it's wrapped in quotes. A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| This is something PHP does automatically when exporting csv, so I'm going to have to do it manually, or "clean" away the quotes afterward :/
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| So... I'll remove them, and I'll add some code to check for semi-colons in the content too, so it doesn't break things... But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| Gonna be pretty light to be honest, so could be every 5 minutes if necessary - but we can see exactly how long it takes to create the files. I suspect it will be a matter of seconds, since there's nothing really complex going on.
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| More question:
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 3. In the user.csv file there is an auth column - I guess to specify how people can log in to the LMS system using this user data. What should we put here? "saml2" in the example is a kind of single sign on protocol but we don't support that (maybe you do via scout id)

2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| That's really annoying because it's normal with csv files to add quotes around strings with possible delimiters (spaces, commas, semi-colons, etc) like "Employment status" since some csv interpretations separate columns on spaces, and also it means that there's no confusion if a group name (for example) contains a comma or semi-colon, since it's wrapped in quotes. A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| This is something PHP does automatically when exporting csv, so I'm going to have to do it manually, or "clean" away the quotes afterward :/
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| So... I'll remove them, and I'll add some code to check for semi-colons in the content too, so it doesn't break things... But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| Gonna be pretty light to be honest, so could be every 5 minutes if necessary - but we can see exactly how long it takes to create the files. I suspect it will be a matter of seconds, since there's nothing really complex going on.
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| More question:
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 3. In the user.csv file there is an auth column - I guess to specify how people can log in to the LMS system using this user data. What should we put here? "saml2" in the example is a kind of single sign on protocol but we don't support that (maybe you do via scout id)
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 4. Most of the files are semi-colon separated, but one is comma separated... Does it matter? Preference?

2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| That's really annoying because it's normal with csv files to add quotes around strings with possible delimiters (spaces, commas, semi-colons, etc) like "Employment status" since some csv interpretations separate columns on spaces, and also it means that there's no confusion if a group name (for example) contains a comma or semi-colon, since it's wrapped in quotes. A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| This is something PHP does automatically when exporting csv, so I'm going to have to do it manually, or "clean" away the quotes afterward :/
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| So... I'll remove them, and I'll add some code to check for semi-colons in the content too, so it doesn't break things... But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 3. In the user.csv file there is an auth column - I guess to specify how people can log in to the LMS system using this user data. What should we put here?

2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| That's really annoying because it's normal with csv files to add quotes around strings with possible delimiters (spaces, commas, semi-colons, etc) like "Employment status" since some csv interpretations separate columns on spaces, and also it means that there's no confusion if a group name (for example) contains a comma or semi-colon, since it's wrapped in quotes. A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.

2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| So... I'll remove them, and I'll add some code to check for semi-colons in the content too, so it doesn't break things... But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

2021-11-29 19:11:47	          	| 1. Should it be all members (15+) in every file? Restricted to main org I guess? Or just those with roles/group memberships/etc?

2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| Gonna be pretty light to be honest, so could be every 5 minutes if necessary - but we can see exactly how long it takes to create the files. I suspect it will be a matter of seconds, since there's nothing really complex going on.
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| More question:
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 3. In the user.csv file there is an auth column - I guess to specify how people can log in to the LMS system using this user data. What should we put here? "saml2" in the example is a kind of single sign on protocol but we don't support that (maybe you do via scout id)
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 4. Most of the files are semi-colon separated, but one is comma separated... Does it matter? Preference?

2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| That's really annoying because it's normal with csv files to add quotes around strings with possible delimiters (spaces, commas, semi-colons, etc) like "Employment status" since some csv interpretations separate columns on spaces, and also it means that there's no confusion if a group name (for example) contains a comma or semi-colon, since it's wrapped in quotes. A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| This is something PHP does automatically when exporting csv, so I'm going to have to do it manually, or "clean" away the quotes afterward :/
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| So... I'll remove them, and I'll add some code to check for semi-colons in the content too, so it doesn't break things... But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 3. In the user.csv file there is an auth column - I guess to specify how people can log in to the LMS system using this user data. What should we put here? "saml2" in the example is a kind of single sign on protocol but we don't support that (maybe you do via scout id)
2021-11-30 13:44:43	          	| 4. Most of the files are semi-colon separated, but one is comma separated... Does it matter? Preference?

2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| That's really annoying because it's normal with csv files to add quotes around strings with possible delimiters (spaces, commas, semi-colons, etc) like "Employment status" since some csv interpretations separate columns on spaces, and also it means that there's no confusion if a group name (for example) contains a comma or semi-colon, since it's wrapped in quotes. A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| This is something PHP does automatically when exporting csv, so I'm going to have to do it manually, or "clean" away the quotes afterward :/
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| So... I'll remove them, and I'll add some code to check for semi-colons in the content too, so it doesn't break things... But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| That's really annoying because it's normal with csv files to add quotes around strings with possible delimiters (spaces, commas, semi-colons, etc) like "Employment status" since some csv interpretations separate columns on spaces, and also it means that there's no confusion if a group name (for example) contains a comma or semi-colon, since it's wrapped in quotes. A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| This is something PHP does automatically when exporting csv, so I'm going to have to do it manually, or "clean" away the quotes afterward :/
2021-12-02 13:39:21	          	| So... I'll remove them, and I'll add some code to check for semi-colons in the content too, so it doesn't break things... But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...
