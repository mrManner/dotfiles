2021-12-01 23:36:58	Sofi	How exactly does the authentication for https://git.sr.ht/graphql work? I have been trying to write up a script that uses the api, but I cant seem to figure out how im supposed to give it a Token. It keeps rejecting the methods i have tried.

2021-12-02 02:32:20	nackjicholson	I'm not understanding how to connect to a particular network from an IRC client that doesn't have a plugin. Can anyone help me?
2021-12-02 02:32:38	nackjicholson	This is with soju / chat.sr.ht
2021-12-02 02:33:22	nackjicholson	I'm using the web chat right now
2021-12-02 02:39:12	eschwartz	There's a blue "add network" in the corner of the "chat.sr.ht" tab
2021-12-02 02:39:36	nackjicholson	Did that
2021-12-02 02:39:38	eschwartz	which is the server buffer for managing the bouncer itself ;)
2021-12-02 02:40:30	eschwartz	ok, so what is the problem? That should be the best way to connect to new networks from the chat.sr.ht webchat
2021-12-02 02:40:51	nackjicholson	Everything works great in the web chat here. I'm failing to be able to connect from my emacs ERC client to channels on libera
2021-12-02 02:41:11	eschwartz	ah, so this is *not* about the webchat
2021-12-02 02:41:21	nackjicholson	Correct
2021-12-02 02:42:21	eschwartz	the basic idea is you connect to the network "chat.sr.ht" and you use the username "mysrhtusername/networkname"
2021-12-02 02:43:49	eschwartz	some IRC clients have native support for soju, e.g. weechat has soju.py, so you can connect as "mysrhtusername" and it communicates with the bouncer and auto-adds a second network as "mysrhtusername/networkname"
2021-12-02 02:45:02	nackjicholson	Okay, so maybe where I've gone wrong is not using my srht username, was trying to use my libera name
2021-12-02 02:45:29	nackjicholson	And the password is still my oauth token?
2021-12-02 02:45:44	nackjicholson	Thank you for your help by the way
2021-12-02 02:45:46	eschwartz	yes
2021-12-02 02:46:14	eschwartz	you are connecting to the bouncer, so you need the bouncer credentials
2021-12-02 02:46:54	eschwartz	(the bouncer is already connected and identified as you)
2021-12-02 02:46:55	nackjicholson	Once I'm in, how would I see channels and join a libeara channel?
2021-12-02 02:47:25	nackjicholson	It seems to still be dropping me right into chat.sr.ht /motd still
2021-12-02 02:47:26	eschwartz	you can /join as normal from any buffer on that network
2021-12-02 02:47:30	eschwartz	hmm
2021-12-02 02:47:55	eschwartz	you should not get the chat.sr.ht motd if you added the "/network" suffix to your username
2021-12-02 02:50:38	eschwartz	e.g. I have 3 networks configured in weechat, all 3 connecting to the chat.sr.ht domain. One is a buffer named "soju", connected as "eschwartz", that has the chat.sr.ht motd and does bouncer management. One is a buffer named "irc.libera.chat", connected as "eschwartz/irc.libera.chat", and that one acts as a normal connection to libera and gives me the libera motd
2021-12-02 02:51:40	nackjicholson	Hmmmm, do I have to use the full address of the upstream, like "irc.libera.chat"? I was just using the -name which I set to libera
2021-12-02 02:52:09	nackjicholson	i.e. myname/libera and not myname/irc.libera.chat

2021-12-02 02:54:45	nackjicholson	I'm going to chalk this up to being emacs fault. Maybe I'll try weechat or irssi to verify
2021-12-02 02:55:33	eschwartz	I used the actual -name irc.libera.chat though

2021-12-02 03:00:42	zoglesby	I would like to do something like soju.py for erc (soju.el?) but need to find the time

2021-12-02 03:14:27	nackjicholson	Can't get it to work from irssi either. Drops me into the chat.sr.ht motd
2021-12-02 03:15:22	nackjicholson	wait, maybe I'm wrong, not familiar enough with irssi to understand if i'm just missing a buffer or something
2021-12-02 03:18:13	nackjicholson	Definitely the same problem from irssi
2021-12-02 03:20:01	eschwartz	well, again -- sr.ht uses single-upstream mode only, so you have one irssi/erc connection to chat.sr.ht per configured network + one for chat.sr.ht itself
2021-12-02 03:20:28	eschwartz	and having a client plugin just means something else does the administrivia of setting up the secondary network connections
2021-12-02 03:20:52	eschwartz	if you have gotten the chat.sr.ht motd, you connected to the bouncer itself instead of using the bouncer to connect to libera
2021-12-02 03:21:18	eschwartz	and if you don't have a plugin, there isn't a second buffer somewhere

2021-12-02 21:34:03	hwrd	okay jess is here cuz I've been having separate discussions with jess in #libera and emersion here. Here's my raw server logs: https://paste.sr.ht/~hwrd/166a1fbc5c2b9a4e8d10c15f666604aebd0ce2f3
2021-12-02 21:34:05	jess	hey :)
2021-12-02 21:34:34	hwrd	there are a few instances of the rate-limiting you can see in the logs. this is what happens when I (re-)connect to the bouncer.
2021-12-02 21:35:45	fluix	is it just me or is paste.sr.ht down?
2021-12-02 21:36:01	@emersion	it's not you
2021-12-02 21:36:16	hwrd	is it cuz it's tryinng to serve my massive log paste
2021-12-02 21:36:31	fluix	ah
2021-12-02 21:36:38	@emersion	yeah, congratulations hwrd :S
2021-12-02 21:36:51	jess	hahaha
2021-12-02 21:36:53	@emersion	definitely paste.sr.ht's mistake to not truncate
2021-12-02 21:36:56	hwrd	fuxor.
2021-12-02 21:37:00	hwrd	lemme re-paste elsewhere.
2021-12-02 21:37:36	hwrd	re-pasted: https://gist.github.com/hahuang65/1b4314dfd26e354d0e84b30bcbb561bb
2021-12-02 21:37:40	@emersion	unfortunately my SSH keys are missing from that host, so i can't investigate
2021-12-02 21:37:55	hwrd	emersion what host? for paste.sr.ht or chat.sr.ht?
2021-12-02 21:37:57	@emersion	hm it doesn't seem that big
2021-12-02 21:38:00	@emersion	paste.sr.ht
2021-12-02 21:38:15	@emersion	maybe it's the server-side syntax highlighting which messes everything up
2021-12-02 21:38:41	@emersion	hwrd: please change your password ASAP
2021-12-02 21:38:41	hwrd	I didn't give it a name, so it shouldn't trigger highlighting right?
2021-12-02 21:38:51	@emersion	your chat.sr.ht password
2021-12-02 21:38:59	hwrd	emersion lol did I include it in the paste?
2021-12-02 21:39:01	hwrd	whoops
2021-12-02 21:39:04	@emersion	yes
2021-12-02 21:39:28	@emersion	next time please delete everything with AUTHENTICATE in it
2021-12-02 21:39:46	hwrd	I thought I did
2021-12-02 21:39:52	hwrd	oh crap. I deleted it in the previous paste
2021-12-02 21:39:56	hwrd	and I just re-pasted the file
2021-12-02 21:39:58	hwrd	derp
2021-12-02 21:40:04	@emersion	rip
2021-12-02 21:40:13	hwrd	emersion there's no token scope for chat.sr.ht yet?
2021-12-02 21:40:30	@emersion	not yet, that's still a TODO
2021-12-02 21:40:41	hwrd	k
2021-12-02 21:40:51	hwrd	anyways, revoked the previous token. thansk for the alert.
2021-12-02 21:40:52	@emersion	the work for it is half-done
2021-12-02 21:41:15	@emersion	ah yeah you can just revoke the token, nice
2021-12-02 21:42:30	jess	i can't see the commands that caused these WHOs
2021-12-02 21:42:32	@emersion	okay so weechat is a bit dumb here
2021-12-02 21:42:40	jess	oh i guess i can
2021-12-02 21:42:44	@emersion	it sends WHO every 4s
2021-12-02 21:42:52	jess	yeah
2021-12-02 21:42:53	jess	that's bad
2021-12-02 21:42:53	@emersion	but doesn't wait for WHO replies to come in before sending the next
2021-12-02 21:43:46	hwrd	"it sends WHO ever 4s" as a response to the JOINs it gets from soju? or just in general?
2021-12-02 21:44:11	@emersion	yeah it sends WHO in response to JOIN, but that's fine
2021-12-02 21:45:38	hwrd	so what's the issue with sending every 4 seconds, or is it more of the "it doesn't wait for the response"?
2021-12-02 21:45:54	hwrd	so it's re-sending multiple per channel?
2021-12-02 21:46:08	@emersion	right, the issue is that it doesn't wait for the WHO command to complete before sending the next one
2021-12-02 21:46:27	@emersion	you're supposed to only have a single WHO command running at a time
2021-12-02 21:46:40	hwrd	I guess either way, maybe I should stop wasting both of your guys time? I supposed eventually this resolves itself as the WHO queue clears out and it doesn't reaally affect chat.sr.ht or libera negatively... right?
2021-12-02 21:46:53	hwrd	it's a weechat fix anyways?
2021-12-02 21:47:32	@emersion	it would be nice if you could open a weechat bug report
2021-12-02 21:47:46	hwrd	I'll absolutely do that. I'll include these logs in it.
2021-12-02 21:47:51	@emersion	yeah it's not an urgent issue
2021-12-02 21:48:00	@emersion	still worth fixing ofc
2021-12-02 21:48:15	hwrd	emersion jess sorry for wasting your times... I actually very much enjoyed this process though. I learned alot haha
2021-12-02 21:48:35	@emersion	no worries at all, glad we found the issue!

2021-12-03 16:13:02	vigoux	Hey did someone update the crypto package on sr.ht in the end or not ?
2021-12-03 16:20:58	@emersion	vigoux: i don't know, but we use this https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/sr.ht-apkbuilds/tree/master/item/sr.ht/py3-pgpy/APKBUILD
2021-12-03 16:23:36	vigoux	I think that the issue came from the Go side of things
2021-12-03 16:23:47	vigoux	That the Go package for crypto related things is outdated
2021-12-03 16:26:07	@emersion	oh right
2021-12-03 16:26:27	@emersion	it's using the deprecated x/crypto
2021-12-03 16:26:31	vigoux	But I never had time to test my patch, and I think I'll never be able to tbh
2021-12-03 16:26:34	vigoux	emersion: yup
2021-12-03 16:26:39	@emersion	haven't seen activity on this
2021-12-03 16:26:46	@emersion	why will you not be able to?
2021-12-03 16:26:51	vigoux	Good afternoon btw, I forgot basic hume interaction
2021-12-03 16:27:14	vigoux	Not enough time, and I've never been able to make it work
2021-12-03 16:27:23	@emersion	rip
2021-12-03 16:28:54	vigoux	But I really think that the patch is just a few lines long
2021-12-03 16:28:57	vigoux	Just can't test it
2021-12-03 16:32:00	vigoux	But it feels pretty inconsistent from a user point of view, that SSH keys can be of type ed25519 but no subkeys of the PGP key can
2021-12-03 16:32:27	vigoux	And, in my case, I can have one of my PGP subkeys as an ssh key, but not my complete PGP key
2021-12-03 16:32:48	vigoux	Do you wan't me to open a ticket for that though ?
2021-12-03 16:33:46	@emersion	i think we already know what the problem is
2021-12-03 16:33:52	@emersion	so no need for a new ticket
2021-12-03 16:33:56	vigoux	okay
2021-12-03 16:34:20	@emersion	just need someone to do the work, no amount of new tickets will magically fix it
2021-12-03 16:34:26	vigoux	yup
2021-12-03 16:51:53	@emersion	noelle: sorry, not yet
2021-12-03 17:02:46	julm	vigoux: I may be able to test your patch, is it available somewhere?
2021-12-03 17:05:52	vigoux	huh nope
2021-12-03 17:05:57	vigoux	Let me try to find it
2021-12-03 17:07:07	vigoux	But basically it is just "replace x/crypto package by https://github.com/ProtonMail/go-crypto"
2021-12-03 17:17:31	julm	vigoux: so, would this be working/enough? go get github.com/ProtonMail/go-crypto && go get golang.org/x/crypto@none && go mod tidy
2021-12-03 17:25:17	vigoux	I think ?
2021-12-03 17:25:22	vigoux	No a go expert
2021-12-03 17:25:29	vigoux	*Not a go expert
2021-12-03 17:29:33	@emersion	no, it's not enough
2021-12-03 17:29:39	@emersion	all imports need to be replaced
2021-12-03 17:29:51	julm	ah, right
2021-12-03 17:29:58	@emersion	but you can quickly test if it would work with a replace directive in go.mod
2021-12-03 17:30:05	minus	unless you have in a replace statement, assuming the api is the same
2021-12-03 17:30:17	@emersion	the API isn't the same, but is close
2021-12-03 17:45:06	julm	oh dear, not knowing where exactly is enough to replace that package makes it hard on me, I'm now down to patching https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/dowork
2021-12-03 17:45:54	@emersion	… i don't think this package uses pgp?
2021-12-03 17:45:57	@emersion	ah
2021-12-03 17:46:04	@emersion	it uses x/crypto maybe?
2021-12-03 17:46:10	julm	and then I would have to find a way to tell the referrers to use my patched dependencies
2021-12-03 17:46:12	julm	yep
2021-12-03 17:46:20	@emersion	we probably only want to use the proto repo for the openpgp package
2021-12-03 17:46:24	@emersion	proton*
2021-12-03 17:46:31	julm	hmm
2021-12-03 17:46:56	@emersion	maybe a replace directive isn't easier then
2021-12-03 17:47:07	@emersion	i'd recommend grepping for openpgp and just replacing these
2021-12-03 17:48:07	julm	ok, that would only be core-go/email/worker.go and meta.sr.ht/api/graph/schema.resolvers.go
2021-12-03 17:48:46	@emersion	sounds good
2021-12-03 17:49:08	@emersion	also you'll need an elliptic PGP key to try it out
2021-12-03 17:49:25	@emersion	maybe vigoux can describe how they generated their key?
2021-12-03 17:57:48	amazigh	re build.sr.ht, it is not a security question, qemu is running inside a docker container?
2021-12-03 17:59:36	@emersion	yes
2021-12-03 18:09:57	okt	Just some minor feedback: UX is amazing. Thank you.
2021-12-03 18:12:16	@emersion	<3
2021-12-03 18:15:31	okt	Redirecting Github funds. Honestly, using the web interface is _Refreshing_. Also, soju addition is primo. Okay, enough gush, off to walk dog in snow.
