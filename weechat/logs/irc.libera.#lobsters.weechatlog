2021-10-13 21:35:48	af	how big does a server need to be
2021-10-13 21:36:43	kline	mostly the issue is going to be your tiny vps provider deciding the network abuse our servers receive and the subsequent impact on your neighbours isnt worth keeping your $2/mo instance around for
2021-10-13 21:37:06	shapr	true that
2021-10-13 21:37:22	af	what if I told you my vps provider is fucking Oracle
2021-10-13 21:37:38	river	fuck!
2021-10-13 21:37:42	shapr	I can see IRC user count going down, but EFNet and all those others were not fun when the ircwarriors were active
2021-10-13 21:40:04	kline	af, our minimum requirements are 2 core, 4GB ram, 20GB disk, be able to burst network nicely (who doesnt have 1Gbit though) but importantly your provider needs to be able to swallow 100G floods and not decide your account is a net-loss and terminate your contract
2021-10-13 21:40:29	kline	if you want it to be an ircd, i think it needs to be a modern 64 bit x86 processor for some of the speedup intrinsics we use

2021-10-13 21:43:10	kline	for bystanders, we dont expect your server to stay on while getting flooded, we just dont want your account terminated because your provider says you're not worth the impact to their rack

2021-12-02 13:59:02	pe	You can clone from the bare, but working trees... maybe.
2021-12-02 13:59:53	pe	It's not obvious to me what you want to achieve.
2021-12-02 14:00:14	amazigh	basically what fossil does, let me explain
2021-12-02 14:01:27	amazigh	I want to deduplicate git history, so that I can git checkout /path/to/BARE-REPO COMMIT ./INSIDE/WORK-DIRECTORY-ONE/
2021-12-02 14:01:54	amazigh	hence avoid to have multiple times the same repo, while still having access to multiple branches
2021-12-02 14:02:38	pe	You want to deduplicate the object tree.
2021-12-02 14:02:46	amazigh	The repository I deal with, is large ~2G, if any time I need to checkout another tree, git clone the whole thing, it becomes unweavy
2021-12-02 14:02:48	rbasak	Maybe "git worktree" is that you want?
2021-12-02 14:03:30	rbasak	It's also possible to clone locally without needing to copy everything by referring to the clone.
2021-12-02 14:03:33	rbasak	(like a symlink)
2021-12-02 14:03:40	gthm	I'd look into git worktree
2021-12-02 14:03:51	rbasak	git clone --reference
2021-12-02 14:04:04	gthm	or if you want very slow read-only checkouts, you could use this terrible FUSE things I wrote once
2021-12-02 14:04:10	rbasak	So you could make a local "master" clone, and then use git clone --reference against it for all the others, and you'd only be storing the repo once.
2021-12-02 14:04:38	 *	amazigh looking at git worktree
2021-12-02 14:05:24	rbasak	Even if you don't use --reference, I think by default hardlinks are used for a local clone, so that doesn't use duplicate space either.
2021-12-02 14:09:53	rb	ooh worktree
2021-12-02 14:09:57	rb	i should use that more

2021-12-02 18:00:00	companion_cube	heh
2021-12-02 18:00:07	companion_cube	elisp is forced on people though

2021-12-02 18:00:42	technomancy	sure but if you don't like it you can pick another editor with a different language; it's not like JS which has a monopoly
2021-12-02 18:02:13	technomancy	all that means is that people don't pick elisp on the strength of the language but the strength of the runtime, which is also true of Clojure for many people

It had a JS slider at the bottom where you could play with the various dimensions of modularity
