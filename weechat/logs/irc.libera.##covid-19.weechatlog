2021-10-13 01:16:00	LjL-Matrix	You probably disagree since you've posted it, but I can't help with that, or rather I won't

2021-10-13 01:16:58	I_AM_THE_LAARWW	Like IRL you wouldn't just walk into a group of people and throw some papers at them and say nothing

2021-10-13 01:17:39	exec_cosmoflips[	LjL-Matrix: What do you mean? There are multiple sources linked throughout the file
2021-10-13 01:17:51	exec_cosmoflips[	Which one is a scam?
2021-10-13 01:17:56	LjL-Matrix	Just for instance the statement "OpenVAERS says 8,088 permanently disabled" is immediately spotted as malicious, because it's implies to be caused by the vaccines, but if one actually looks at what VAERS says about itself, it definitely does NOT claim to have reports that *are caused* by the vaccines. They are whatever people report, if people think they may be related to a vaccine, they'll report them in association with that vaccine.
2021-10-13 01:18:18	exec_cosmoflips[	Yeah ofc
2021-10-13 01:18:25	LjL-Matrix	exec_cosmoflips: I hovered on a bunch and they went to https://www.skirsch.com
2021-10-13 01:18:29	exec_cosmoflips[	That argument is addressed later on
2021-10-13 01:19:22	LjL-Matrix	Another thing, the "Vision test", "Can you spot the unsafe vaccine?" - I have an obvious follow-up question, "Can you spot the only vaccine that was given to BILLIONS of people in a few MONTHS and that drew worldwide attention for a year?"
2021-10-13 01:19:46	LjL-Matrix	(... during a pandemic, when there are excess deaths anyway)
2021-10-13 01:19:47	exec_cosmoflips[	Good point
2021-10-13 01:21:02	LjL-Matrix	"And it’s all for nothing... In Israel, the vaccines are making no difference in protecting people from being infected; the core use case" - So it's not-so-subtly jumping from "it's ALL for nothing" to "it's for nothing in one specific way, that we arbitrarily decide is core". But obviously not making a lot of people die is a worthwhile goal even if they get infected anyway. But it's easier to write something like that in big letters
2021-10-13 01:21:03	LjL-Matrix	instead...

2021-10-13 01:22:34	exec_cosmoflips[	Yeah, he failed to make a coherent point there
2021-10-13 01:22:49	LjL-Matrix	Then "In fact, it appears vaccination is making 
2021-10-13 01:22:49	LjL-Matrix	things worse" has another classic misleading indication: "81% of Covid-19 deaths are among the vaccinated", which is pointless when you don't specify how many are vaccinate and which age and risk groups they're in. It may be addressed elsewhere but there's a clear implication done by copypasting (actually, screenshotting, so I couldn't even copypaste it myself and had to re-type it) such a headline
2021-10-13 01:23:22	dTal	ah the old simpsons paradox again
2021-10-13 01:24:12	LjL-Matrix	"So they changed the story... “the vaccines help prevent you from dying if you get infected”"  ~  yes, well, Delta changed the story. There was a fair chance (not at all a certainty, many people *always* stressed it was a certainty, although I was honestly among the ones who thought it was the case) that the vaccine would prevent infection and transmission. But with Delta they definitely don't do those things well. But the "story" was
2021-10-13 01:24:12	LjL-Matrix	given before Delta was around, so, uh, yeah, it was changed, because the virus did
2021-10-13 01:24:15	dTal	if you vaccinated every single person, 100% of Covid-19 deaths would be among the vaccinated - although the number of deaths would be lower.

2021-10-13 01:26:26	dTal	Conversely, I can truthfully claim that not a single person who has drunk my miracle elixer has died of Covid-19
2021-10-13 01:26:31	LjL-Matrix	"But that’s not true either if you are <50. Vaccines make you slightly more likely to die if you get infected"  —   this is also clearly based on a wrong reading of the data, because if one reads the screenshotted *thing it says*, the initial cohort that makes up the whole table is "people who attended to emergency care + deaths of people who were sequenced". So you can't just pretend those are the percentage of vaccinated vs
2021-10-13 01:26:31	LjL-Matrix	unvaccinated people who died. The "computation" he makes as "Computation: Death rate of unvaxed < Death rate of vaxed since 132/248803 < 48/85407  (.053% < .056%)" is meaningless.

2021-10-13 01:27:20	LjL-Matrix	It's like... among the people who were infected and had to show up for emergency care, yeah, since they were already in a pretty bad shape, about the same amount died whether vaccinated or not

2021-10-30 17:40:16	de-facto	yes as long as the pathogen is in circulation we only have two options 1) control its spread by ending infection chains 2) ignore its presence and accept all the increasing problems such as it evading immunity and becoming more aggressive
2021-10-30 17:40:21	+Brainstorm	Updates for Netherlands: +7952 cases (now 2.2 million), +13 deaths (now 18836) since 14 hours ago — Jordan: +1022 cases (now 860818), +12 deaths (now 11028), +21666 tests (now 10.9 million) since 22 hours ago
2021-10-30 17:40:36	de-facto	or oscillating in between those as we are doing it right now
2021-10-30 17:42:15	de-facto	steering always into another direction of course will lead to waves, letting it saturate will lead to a more stable maximum contamination

2021-10-30 17:45:14	Arsanerit	The only way to avoid mutants would be to eradicate it worldwide; for a virus where such a high proportion has no or mild symptoms (even if not vaccinated), that does not seem to be a realistic prospect, and I'm not convinced society worldwide is willing to pay what it takes.  That has only succeeded with viruses that cause much worse diseases (smallbox, ebola).
2021-10-30 17:45:57	de-facto	well its still on its path to become more aggressive and diverse in terms of lineages
2021-10-30 17:46:00	Arsanerit	Oh, rinderpest too.
2021-10-30 17:46:30	Arsanerit	If it kills 30% and leaves the rest blind, I strongly suspect people are willing to accept more restrictions again.
2021-10-30 17:48:12	de-facto	well that is part of the probem, people still think its harmless, yet its not and it becomes more problematic with each wave by new variant of concern
2021-10-30 17:48:49	Arsanerit	Maybe it is the "problem" that it's harmless to the majority of infected people and the large majority of infected vaccinated people.
2021-10-30 17:49:47	de-facto	should we really breed this until it became problematic enough that everyone is convinced that the associated problem became serious enough to reason for finally containing it?
2021-10-30 17:50:17	Arsanerit	I don't think it will ever be contained worldwide.
2021-10-30 17:52:17	de-facto	then it will further progress on its trajectory to become more fit in the human body under the current most widely spread selective pressure by pre-existing antibodies and thereby increase the associated problem by evading immunity and increasing associated severity
2021-10-30 17:52:52	de-facto	i mean why would that not happen?
2021-10-30 17:53:04	Arsanerit	yet at the same time, the human immune system aided by continued vaccine development will help the body to defend against it
2021-10-30 17:53:12	de-facto	its the path we already can observe and it also is exactly what we would expect
2021-10-30 17:53:58	Arsanerit	A new virus can eradicate entire populations, such as happened in the Americas after Europeans invaded.
2021-10-30 17:54:13	de-facto	well yes but to what degree will it be able to defend the human body against it? the damage originates from the immune system itself due to the viral infection
2021-10-30 17:54:13	Arsanerit	The impact on a population where the virus has been circulating for a long time is less severe.
2021-10-30 17:54:50	Arsanerit	I don't know.  I'm not a virologist.
2021-10-30 17:54:54	de-facto	only if the virus has reached some natural limit in increasing its fitness
2021-10-30 17:55:06	de-facto	so where would that be with SARS-CoV-2
2021-10-30 17:55:32	de-facto	has it already optimized all its mechanisms that help with viral replication?
2021-10-30 17:55:47	de-facto	i doubt it
2021-10-30 17:58:30	de-facto	what we really should look at is long COVID
2021-10-30 17:59:53	de-facto	i think this is causing more damage than we think and we should not risk producing long COVID cases at maximum possible rate when aiming for saturating infections
2021-10-30 17:59:59	+Brainstorm	New from COVID tweets: Michal Tal, PhD (@ImmunoFever): I had to delete a tweet that got picked up by trolls. All I'm going to say is that vaccine confidence is NOT thinking that you're now bullet proof against this virus and you can't possibly catch it or pass it to your kids.

2021-12-02 02:05:00	Dredd	Huh odd, cloudflare person there claims that the archive.is nameservers are returning bad data to cloudflare lol

2021-12-02 02:06:39	Dredd	Looks like for some reason archive.is have some sort of issue that stops cloudflare fetching valid records
2021-12-02 02:06:51	Dredd	Who runs archive.is? Is it archive.org?
2021-12-02 02:07:03	LjL	no, different archiver

2021-12-02 02:09:37	LjL	seems like a meaningful difference between archive.is and archive.org (also webcitation.org, RIP) is that archive.is *does not* attempt to respect robots.txt
2021-12-02 02:09:41	Dredd	That is them, disregarding the technical data they've been provided

2021-12-02 02:09:52	Dredd	So incompetent 😛 
2021-12-02 02:10:02	Dredd	I don't think it's blocked at all
2021-12-02 02:10:12	Dredd	It seems like they made some effort to fix it for IPv4 but never for IPv6
2021-12-02 02:10:17	Dredd	Which might be the problem for me
2021-12-02 02:10:19	LjL	Dredd, well do you clearly understand that the issue really is on archive.is's site? cloudflare may as well be blaming it on them in turn

2021-12-02 02:19:26	LjL	it's unsurprising that leads to developers who are usually pompous assholes. or well the other way around, i'm not sure.
2021-12-02 02:21:34	Dredd	I have a theory that archive.today blocks cloudflare to stop their CDN caching their previous archives 😛. It seems they are in some way making money with ads / ad replacements?
2021-12-02 02:22:14	LjL	Dredd, by the way, this is the actual twitter post that led Brainstorm to post that @zerohedge post that cited JP Morgan: https://twitter.com/fitterhappierAJ/status/1466194261796392961
2021-12-02 02:22:18	Dredd	It would be interesting if someone from akamai, cloudfront or some other CDN would report whether they are also getting intentionally broken dns records

2021-12-02 02:23:53	Dredd	It's a complex system and those ideas are theories
2021-12-02 02:24:06	LjL	i'm not sure why there is both, anyway. *the* tweet that comes from my list is Leonardi's, not whatever he's retweeting.

2021-12-02 02:25:24	LjL	Dredd, i got so mad earlier on TV they were blabbering how news of the Omicron variant "without even knowing" whether it's mild or not (oh my, so sorry we don't know yet! next time we'll try to know) caused stock exchange turmoil and "is depressing the economy of our small and medium enterprises" (seriously?)
2021-12-02 02:25:48	Dredd	lol yeah
2021-12-02 02:25:52	LjL	so *because* financial people like to freak out whenever a drop of rain hits the ground and make the stock exchange go up and down... we shouldn't say there's a new variant?
2021-12-02 02:26:13	LjL	"don't tell us things, we make the economy go bad if you do! err, i mean, YOU make the economy go bad!"
2021-12-02 02:26:14	Dredd	The financial markets are very volatile today and that's for sure somewhat related to omicron but also related to the rampant speculation it triggers 😛

2021-12-02 21:30:33	Arsanerit	It would seem that banning unvaccinated people from bookshops has more to do with pressuring people to get vaccinated (one step short of mandatory vaccinations) than with reducing infections.  Bookshops are rarely crowded.

2021-12-02 23:51:56	LjL	what gets me mad though is the complacency. it's not as bad as last year *so* we can be content with the vaccines we have... instead of developing (quickly!) vaccines for Alpha, Beta, Delta... until an Omicron comes along. really the trials for variant-specific vaccines, and potentially sterilizing vaccines like intranasal ones, have started ages ago, but i think they're just not being funded, because governments are "happier" just buying more Pfizer
2021-12-02 23:52:21	LjL	(i don't think it's a coincidence that Pfizer's line is that the current vaccine will probably work, while Moderna which is smaller and more agile says the vaccine may NOT work but they are ready to come up with a variant vaccine)

2021-12-02 23:54:12	xx	but I've recently been comparing it to the whole situation in africa, where vulnerable people simply don't reach adulthood and similarly don't reach old-age, and that's why the rona is not as bad there
2021-12-02 23:54:20	LjL	i'm somewhat surprised as i realized it's not being talked about now, after the first couple of days

2021-12-02 23:55:08	LjL	xx, yes, but in western countries, although there has definitely already been an impact on the calculated life expectancy, there's still a large number of elderly and/or vulnerable people
2021-12-02 23:55:29	LjL	they might not all have a lifestyle that makes it *very* likely they'll catch it, but anyone can catch it unless they literally bunker in

2021-12-03 09:09:09	Dredd	<sdfgsdfg> "xx : The only person I know..." <- Are you implying the vaccines didn't help or worse, that they caused her death?
2021-12-03 09:09:58	xx	let me check backlog to see what I meant there
2021-12-03 09:11:03	xx	where was that?
2021-12-03 09:11:44	xx	I don't know where that was, but I can definitely answer that I don't know anyone who'd die as a result of the vaccine, though I'm sure someone somewhere probably did just due to statistics

2021-12-03 10:40:29	Dredd	Oh that reminds me, I need to go to a pharmacy some time to try and get a walk in flu jab appointment
2021-12-03 10:40:51	CoJaBo	I'm still debating whether or not to get a flushot
2021-12-03 10:40:56	Dredd	joerg: that wouldn't work in the UK. Even the idea of checking someones papers sets off UK people
2021-12-03 10:41:07	Dredd	And shops are refusing to enforce the mask mandate here
2021-12-03 10:41:11	joerg	Dredd: even the fines are already defined, and they are rather steep (iirc 2500€)
2021-12-03 10:41:13	Dredd	Even though it's law
2021-12-03 10:41:26	Dredd	So there's no way they would confront people for vaccines
2021-12-03 10:41:44	Dredd	Who enforces the fine? The supermarkets would just not report anything here
2021-12-03 10:42:23	joerg	the 2k5 fine is for shop owners not checking
2021-12-03 10:42:25	Dredd	Lol, UK people have raged at the idea of vaccination being mandatory for frontline health workers even
2021-12-03 10:42:35	Dredd	How will they know?
2021-12-03 10:42:43	CoJaBo	Lol, around here it's more common to find shops that ban vaccinated people from entering
2021-12-03 10:42:56	Dredd	Also 2.5k for a national supermarket might just be worth paying

2021-12-03 11:07:11	rpifan	hm thats really not good news
2021-12-03 11:07:20	rpifan	apparently they will make us get boosters every year
2021-12-03 11:09:19	joerg	12 months (like flu) sounds reasonable, yes. I prefer that over lockdown and death from covid, heck even over long covid
2021-12-03 11:10:35	joerg	and once we "are done vaccinating everybody" you are free to get your annual refresh by catching the rona as well
2021-12-03 11:10:54	joerg	like we got with flu
2021-12-03 11:15:33	joerg	right now we got the problem that even in "good" countries we have a nn% of completely corona-naive population and we know they ALL will catch the virus and out of 100, maybe 2 or 5 will get a severe course and end in hospital and ICU
2021-12-03 11:16:50	joerg	once nobody is corona-naive anymore, that will end, no matter if you vaccinate everybody every year or not
2021-12-03 11:17:09	joerg	compare for flu
2021-12-03 11:17:28	joerg	*here* corona actually is just another flu
2021-12-03 11:21:07	rpifan	yea
2021-12-03 11:21:12	rpifan	but im already genesen 
2021-12-03 11:21:16	joerg	and let me add: we got districts in germany with almost 2000/100k7d - plain math tells that those districts will be done with corina in 50 weeks the latest
2021-12-03 11:21:16	rpifan	why do i need to get a vaccine
2021-12-03 11:21:28	rpifan	its really annoying
2021-12-03 11:21:31	joerg	corona too
2021-12-03 11:22:08	joerg	rpifan: because if you're not, you occupy the ICU bed I need for my cancer OP
2021-12-03 11:22:23	joerg	and I have to pay for your idiocy
2021-12-03 11:22:51	joerg	not only in money but also in lockdown I suffer, and in my own health and lifetime
2021-12-03 11:23:20	joerg	no mercy
2021-12-03 11:23:20	rpifan	thats not really true
2021-12-03 11:23:28	joerg	that IS true
2021-12-03 11:23:32	rpifan	ive already had covid
2021-12-03 11:23:39	joerg	meh!
2021-12-03 11:23:42	joerg	fool
2021-12-03 11:23:55	joerg	then you are immunized already
2021-12-03 11:24:06	joerg	just not very well
2021-12-03 11:24:24	rpifan	but we cant just force ppl to get vaciinated year after year
2021-12-03 11:25:01	joerg	strongly recommended to get a second and third immunization pass
2021-12-03 11:25:59	joerg	rpifan: after 3 jabs, immunization is considered "finished" and - as I just elaborated - we are not short on ICU beds anymore when everybody is
2021-12-03 11:27:15	joerg	I *strongly* oppose any live long recurring mandatory vaccination
2021-12-03 11:27:32	joerg	not needed
2021-12-03 11:29:48	joerg	rpifan: after 3rd pass (booster) you probably are protected from severe course for several years, and you will catch mild covid every other year and so refresh your immune protection without occupying an ICU bed
2021-12-03 11:30:03	rpifan	im not convinced
2021-12-03 11:30:12	rpifan	we had started out with 2
2021-12-03 11:30:14	rpifan	and now 3?

2021-12-03 11:33:43	darsie	Has there been herd immunity somewhere?
2021-12-03 11:34:23	joerg	we didn't know 2 jabs were not a complete vaccination cycle. We learnd that recently, it's a 3 pass regimen obviously. After 3 passes you got a protection against severe course for several years since even with 2 you get a protection of more than one year. And if we had a 100% vaccinated with 2 jabs now, we wouldn't _need_ a booster. It would still be wise but not mandatory
2021-12-03 11:40:08	joerg	re novavax: there **never** been a vaccine controlled, evaluated and tested more thoroughly than the ones already available and in use. NEVER, for ANY disease, not even same league
2021-12-03 11:40:53	joerg	the age old flu vaccination never been same magnitude of safety
2021-12-03 11:43:33	joerg	9 months ago you could argue "I'm not convinced yet, I want to see how it pans out". Now there are BILLIONS of months of tight observation for any adverse effects and the vaccines *are* safe
2021-12-03 11:48:57	joerg	we should mix the vaccine with Jaegermeister and hand it out at discount price on parties, I guess ;-P
2021-12-03 11:49:56	joerg	you say you don't know what's in the vaccine? do you know what's in Jaegermeister? or in Coca Cola? For the vaccine you _could_ know if you only looked it up

2021-12-03 15:48:30	de-facto	joerg, unless the protection from reinfection was around 50% in first place
2021-12-03 15:48:58	joerg	:nod:
2021-12-03 15:52:13	joerg	de-facto: from the lancet article you linked: >>There is no reason to believe that current COVID-19 treatment protocols and therapeutics would no longer be effective, with the possible exception of monoclonal antibodies, for which data on the omicron variant's susceptibility are not yet available<<  I disagree here, we seen reports that state MAB work on omicron, no?
2021-12-03 15:54:35	de-facto	well since an advantage from mAbs treatments are that they are very specific, hence only affect and target the virus itself (with minimal side effects) its also a disadvantage in this case because being specific to some characteristic surface of the virus means if that surface changed it could avoid binding to a certain degree
2021-12-03 15:55:02	de-facto	meaning it depends on the mAb in question: does it bind to a conserved or mutated surface?
2021-12-03 15:55:11	joerg	>>New from COVID on Twitter: Eric Topol (@EricTopol): Good to see the @Vir_Biotech/ @GSK monoclonal antibody (Sotrovimab) retains activity vs Omicron mutations in lab testsbiorxiv.org/content/10.110… → https://twitter.com/EricTopol/status/1466417111740436490<<

2021-12-03 15:55:31	de-facto	some will be evaded, others not, so it really depends on which particular mAb we would talk about
2021-12-03 15:56:11	joerg	yeah, ok. Maybe I'm nitpicking
2021-12-03 15:57:13	joerg	anyway >>...for which data on the omicron variant's susceptibility are not yet available<< seems incorrect
