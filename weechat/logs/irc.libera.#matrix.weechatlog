2021-10-13 06:09:56	j1m6h[m]	Probably more secure considering it's decentralized. 
2021-10-13 06:10:26	j1m6h[m]	Well I know in private messages only you and the receiver are the only ones who can see the messages. Because everything is end to end encrypted.
2021-10-13 06:10:26	yeocol[m]	I like the idea to not have a specific service as my messaging solution but a network which can accept any app
2021-10-13 06:10:26	yeocol[m]	j1m6h I'm not an expert in data security but how / where are all the uploaded images / files stored? And could anyone somehow open/see stuff I send on here when it's decentralized?

2021-10-30 17:53:28	voice	that said as a server admin myself and having tested message/event reporting all it does is log it in a db table, the admin(s) have to be actively checking that for it to be effective

2021-12-01 23:37:17	spokojni[m]	check the timestamps on  screenshot

2021-12-01 23:39:16	morguldir	cvmn: with matrix you can use which server you want, and this server may have large issues, but the messages will still try to arrive at some point
2021-12-01 23:39:48	cvmn	morguldir: are these delay issues more in matrix than irc?
2021-12-01 23:41:01	spokojni[m]	I am receiving push messages and seeing actual messages in the room at different rate....first it's visible as bubble notification, then it's visible in the room after some time

2021-12-01 23:43:40	morguldir	cvmn: in this case specifically i don't think it would arrive on IRC at all
2021-12-01 23:44:13	cvmn	i wonder if matrix's http api makes it much slower.
2021-12-01 23:44:24	voice	Penncilk[m], m.type is added to m.room

2021-12-01 23:46:08	morguldir	spokojni[m]: notifications would be pushed from your server pretty quickly, but the client is probably retrieving messages slower than your server is retrieving them (when it would push). Did you shut down your server or something?
2021-12-01 23:47:36	spokojni[m]	seems it's working fine again now...nope,server is still up

2021-12-02 07:46:45	geuristic[m]	I plan to use a VM for bug-testing Xfce, does anyone have any suggestions for which distro I should test it on?
2021-12-02 07:50:15	dibi58[m]	geuristic[m]: probably debian server and ubuntu server, but some version dont have xfce, ubuntu 18.04 LTS server has it, 20.04 LTS server does not but installed lxde that is equally light 
2021-12-02 07:52:56	geuristic[m]	dibi58[m]: Actually, I want to contribute to Xfce by filing bugs that I find in the DE, so I wanted opinions on which distro with Xfce would be ideal to run inside a VM for said bug-testing
2021-12-02 07:58:02	dibi58[m]	geuristic[m]: sounds a nice idea, sorry cant help, i always start from servers so im not a good case for testing distros or desktops ... generally i try to run at least four desktops on each system, all very light just in case ...

2021-12-02 10:30:09	masterpe[m]	<ptman[m]> "michiel, https://matrix.org/..." <- Yes, sorry I already looked at that page but I could not find a bridge for Zoom.
2021-12-02 10:58:24	_lonelycat_[m]	<masterpe[m]> "Yes, sorry I already looked at..." <- So, maybe there is no bridge to zoom. Since zoom using it's own wrbrtc implementation.
2021-12-02 10:58:24	_lonelycat_[m]	And there is a progress around matrix voip, toward group conversation on webrtc. Hope they reach a better result on testing
2021-12-02 11:00:53	masterpe[m]	_lonelycat_: I already feared, that there is no implementation for Zoom, but I hoped that something was known about that it was in the making.
2021-12-02 11:14:51	_lonelycat_[m]	<masterpe[m]> "_lonelycat_: I already feared..." <- Matrix was using jitsi instance to get webrtc implementation. Now, trying forward by that to get more integrated inside. While zoom already run their own as a close way in their own business. 
2021-12-02 11:14:51	_lonelycat_[m]	Even try connecting jitsi to zoom seems never been a progress. Maybe I miss some info around that

2021-12-02 12:25:03	RolandSharp[m]	Hey everyone, first time on Matrix. How is it possible to encrypt a public room ? 
2021-12-02 12:25:44	ninchuka[m]	RolandSharp[m]: you need to be admin then goto the room settings and enable encryption
2021-12-02 12:26:15	ninchuka[m]	but there's no point really in encrypting a public room since its public
2021-12-02 12:27:53	RolandSharp[m]	ninchuka[m]: ahh cool. why wouldn't that be by default ?
2021-12-02 12:28:25	RolandSharp[m]	ninchuka[m]: okay got it
2021-12-02 12:28:48	ninchuka[m]	RolandSharp[m]: especially on massive rooms, encryption can be very laggy and lots of bridges wont work and there's no point since most other chat services arent encrypted
2021-12-02 12:30:36	RolandSharp[m]	ninchuka[m]: okay got it thanks

2021-12-02 20:31:22	logicwizard[m]	Both voice and video ??
2021-12-02 20:33:17	ninchuka[m]	logicwizard[m]: by default if you start a DM with someone the room is E2EE and if you cal it'll be P2P which is E2EE as well, currently group calls are through jitsi which support E2EE but its not enabled by default
2021-12-02 20:44:30	Cat[m]	And Native Group VOIP is on its way that is also E2EE

2021-12-02 22:10:17	Aminda-	I am not sure I understand your question, but IRC would enforce different nicknames (except in case Ergo and integrated bouncer in which case overlapping names from IRC are simply not shown to Matrix) and the accounts would connect from a different IPv6 address and have different realnames
2021-12-02 22:16:24	morguldir	When people join different rooms that are both bridged to the same IRC room, the bridge will create a puppet user containing their username + [m] to make sure the other room sees the messages, so what happens when there are multiple people with the same username?

2021-12-02 23:45:28	morguldir	<Cat[m]> "Why does the IRC bridge need..." <- Because it supports multiple rooms for the same IRC channel, the original reason was that plumbed rooms could prevent you from using the bridge as a bouncer if the plumbed room was broken. This could also make it easier to run multiple bridges alongside each other. Sending the message over matrix instead of parsing it as an IRC message should make it work better in most cases, and I'm not sure if
2021-12-02 23:45:29	morguldir	the bridge receives messages it sent itself either, in which case it would be just as simple to duplicate it

2021-12-03 07:53:18	Arche[m]	I don’t know much about maubot but I do know it can “respond” to text
2021-12-03 07:54:43	_lonelycat_[m]	Arche[m]: It's better if it is just a permalink to origin message
2021-12-03 07:55:14	Arche[m]	Arche[m]: for example cat disrupter does this https://github.com/maubot/disruptor/
2021-12-03 07:55:28	Arche[m]	*disruptor
2021-12-03 08:50:19	MadMonkey[m]	<Arche[m]> "for example cat disrupter does..." <- Thanks, I'll check it😁
2021-12-03 10:30:28	bzalan[m]	Hello everyone, is there a documentation for matrix react sdk somwhere?
2021-12-03 10:31:57	ptman[m]	https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/tree/develop/docs ?
2021-12-03 10:39:36	indiscrete_void[	Is it possible to create access token with restricted access to account (e.g. only send/read messages, but not delete them) ? 
2021-12-03 10:41:25	bzalan[m]	<ptman[m]> "https://github.com/matrix-org/..." <- Yes i've seen this one, but i am trying to build my own webclient but it just doesn't provide enough information. Should I look deeper in the code?
2021-12-03 10:42:25	ptman[m]	indiscrete_void, I don't think you can scope/restrict tokens in synapse currently
2021-12-03 10:43:20	ptman[m]	indiscrete_void, https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2615
2021-12-03 10:48:54	tulir	<bzalan[m]> "Yes i've seen this one, but i am..." <- probably not. matrix-react-sdk is not actually an sdk that can be used to build web clients
2021-12-03 10:49:33	OctopusAqua[m]	11
2021-12-03 10:50:16	tulir	you should probably look into using a js sdk (like matrix-js-sdk or matrix-bot-sdk) and building your own UI, or just embedding some client (that has decent UI when embedded)
2021-12-03 10:54:30	bzalan[m]	Thanks for the answers!
2021-12-03 11:02:37	bzalan[m]	<tulir> "probably not. matrix-react-sdk..." <- But wait, what it is used for then?
2021-12-03 11:02:59	tulir	it's not technically used for anything, it is element web
2021-12-03 11:03:53	bzalan[m]	Sorry for asking too much, but i got a bit confused
2021-12-03 11:03:53	tulir	if you look in the subdirectories of https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/tree/develop/src, you'll notice there are only a handful of files there. That's because basically all the code is in matrix-react-sdk
2021-12-03 11:04:18	bzalan[m]	Ooh, i see
2021-12-03 11:08:47	hewwo12[m]	is for anybody else in Linux the shortcut ctrl+Q => Close Element not working? Elements just keeps being open, only way to fully close is rightclicking the system tray and quit from there...

2021-12-03 12:35:14	tomman	been using matrix-purple (Pidgin), but also have Nheko as fallback

2021-12-03 12:36:35	tomman	neither nheko nor Quaternion allow me to set an avatar (at least, I don't see an option anywhere, but I can see other members'/room avatars)
2021-12-03 12:36:57	tomman	Pidgin does, but then, it doesn't display avatars on my contact list
2021-12-03 12:37:27	tomman	In any case, what I want to know is how to tell when I need special permissions to talk on a public room
2021-12-03 12:38:17	Nico[m]	tomman: If you are not on an old Nheko, you can click on the top left, where your avatar is and then the edit button on your avatar

2021-12-03 12:43:58	tomman	(had to install nheko just to create my account, because as I've said, Element won't work on SeaMonkey, and I'm not installing FF/Chrome on any of my PCs)

2021-12-03 17:04:40	neonmaddie_[m]	Is there a way I can use SSO login as an alternative login? Since my Matrix account has my email, is there a way I can use “Login with GitHub” to login into my Matrix account because they have the same email? I think Mozilla homeserver does this.
2021-12-03 17:13:35	DavidPrieto[m]	Hi. Any idea what [this](https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/26/eu_digital_markets_act/) might mean for Matrix?
2021-12-03 17:16:11	grinn[m]	David Prieto: maybe matrix shall reveal the secrets of the protocol! Or, maybe, they have to let other people to use the servers for their external clients. Scary!

2021-12-03 17:27:42	santasbigbootied	whats the benefits to the network by setting up a synapse?
2021-12-03 17:27:49	santasbigbootied	i see instructions on how-to on the githum but... why
2021-12-03 17:27:52	ilmaisin[m]	I'd hope that they at least prevent im vendors from using the legal system to harass the developers of 3rd party clients, and preferably also stop them from banning their users

2021-12-03 19:08:49	AblioCosta[m]	Hey! I have a space with a couple of rooms. Now a second user was set as "Admin" for that space. Altough he can create new rooms there, he cannot do much in the already existing rooms since it did not become a moderator for those. Is it possible to apply permissions recursively?

2021-12-03 19:56:55	AblioCosta[m]	Yeah, I think so. But it would be great to be able to have a better way to manage room permissions in a space.
