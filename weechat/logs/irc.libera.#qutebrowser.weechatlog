2021-10-30 17:25:45	The-Compiler	Hund: for web content? Terminus is a bitmap font, but Chromium doesn't support those

2021-10-30 17:27:14	The-Compiler	it's probably either Terminus or "xos4 Terminus" IIRC (including the quotes)

2021-12-01 23:34:06	mornfall	oh dear me… there 140 threads at the time of the crash
2021-12-01 23:34:25	elshize	mornfall: that is many threads
2021-12-01 23:34:37	elshize	I don't blame it for crashing lol
2021-12-01 23:35:48	mornfall	anyway, i guess it's not python nor qb at fault… the segv happens in * 2    thread 353425     0x00000f682ce4b94e in ?? () from /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/dri/iris_dri.so
2021-12-01 23:36:02	mornfall	lovely :\
2021-12-01 23:36:36	mornfall	first thing in the stack that's got a symbol to it is #6  0x00000f692274ee99 in gl::GLApiBase::glTexImage2DFn(unsigned int, int, int, int, int, int, unsigned int, unsigned int, void const*) () from /usr/local/lib/qt5/libQt5WebEngineCore.so.1.0
2021-12-01 23:37:47	elshize	is that something recurring?
2021-12-01 23:38:11	elshize	not that I can help, you'll have to wait for someone smarter
2021-12-01 23:40:16	mornfall	yeah, crashes reliably on session restore
2021-12-01 23:42:19	elshize	bummer
2021-12-01 23:42:40	elshize	I mean, good for debugging, bad for you know, browsing
2021-12-01 23:43:24	natris1979[m]	Anything graphically intensive on that session?
2021-12-01 23:44:47	mornfall	opening a twitter tab crashed the thing, but i nuked those 2 tabs from the session and it didn't help
2021-12-01 23:45:03	natris1979[m]	I'm probably not going to be much help either. That kinda thing is pretty outside my wheelhouse
2021-12-01 23:45:05	mornfall	probably a bug in the gpu driver or somwehere else in the operating system
2021-12-01 23:48:13	mornfall	i guess i could try restarting X to see if that helps
2021-12-01 23:48:44	natris1979[m]	yeah, that's my suspicicion. Though I do wonder if there's something in that QtWebEngine function that isn't properly handling some error it gets from the gpu. Like ultimately it's propobably a driver issue, but I doubt it should blow up like that
2021-12-01 23:49:28	natris1979[m]	that kinda situation sucks because your like "rebooting might fix this, but if it does, I'll never know why"
2021-12-01 23:49:59	mornfall	i'll run into it again, eventually; it's not the first time this happened
2021-12-01 23:50:25	mornfall	spamming tabs will usually do it; the bug actually improved my browsing habits quite a bit :p
2021-12-01 23:50:36	mornfall	i still hate it tho
2021-12-01 23:51:00	natris1979[m]	although I just saw that you said that function was just the first thing in the stack with a symbol. So ifyou've got some issue in a binary blob driver, well then who the heck knows
2021-12-01 23:51:04	natris1979[m]	* heck knows?
2021-12-01 23:54:22	topcat001	It could also be that under memory pressure something is corrupting memory. If that happened then the actual crash will show up at a completely unrelated place, when it finally hits the corruption. Just speculating here.
2021-12-01 23:54:44	topcat001	Does the crash happen in iris_dri every time?
2021-12-02 00:02:28	mornfall	there's gigabytes of free ram
2021-12-02 00:03:01	mornfall	both in the system and in the limit in the process
2021-12-02 00:03:11	mornfall	the session restores okay after reboot
2021-12-02 00:04:16	mornfall	i have another machine with the same system and a gpu one generation older (intel 620 vs intel 630) that does not suffer from this
2021-12-02 00:04:51	topcat001	ok then could be a driver issue.
2021-12-02 00:05:15	mornfall	well, i have noticed a knob that's been set differently between them, so i'll see if that changes anything; but of course the different hardware cannot be helped
2021-12-02 00:15:25	elshize	mornfall: is this some kind of fancy intel gpu that requires special drivers? I always thought intel worked with open source drivers
2021-12-02 00:16:56	mornfall	it's the standard oss intel driver
2021-12-02 00:17:18	elshize	mornfall: oh, ok

2021-12-02 09:47:50	pylbrecht	Good morning guys, maybe someone can help me out with this https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/6855#issuecomment-984327048
2021-12-02 09:56:40	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: I'm confused why we are using an old pylint version, we should not
2021-12-02 09:58:21	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: then I would try to use the latest and see if CI is green. Should I do it in the same PR or in a separate one?
2021-12-02 09:58:42	The-Compiler	lol we're using a >2 year old pylint version and nobody noticed until now? nice
2021-12-02 10:00:55	The-Compiler	ah it was due to https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/issues/772
2021-12-02 10:01:20	The-Compiler	I guess I missed it being fixed...
2021-12-02 10:10:07	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: as I expected, lots of new checks added in the meantime :D
2021-12-02 10:10:44	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: that means this isn't just about recompiling requirements, but also fixing many many issues?
2021-12-02 10:11:52	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: yeah - I'd be happy to do it, unless you feel like doing it, but it can get repetitive
2021-12-02 10:12:18	The-Compiler	some new checks should probably be suppressed, but others could be genuine
2021-12-02 10:14:05	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: well, this seems to block the issue I'm currently working on, so if you don't get to it soon, I'm happy to do that. Although I might not be as fast as you.
2021-12-02 10:14:42	The-Compiler	I should have some time this afternoon if students don't have too many questions
2021-12-02 10:15:03	The-Compiler	perfect environment for that kind of work actually, can't do stuff requiring too much focus
2021-12-02 10:18:37	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: I suppose if you want to go on in the meantime, you could remove the <2.5 from misc/requirements/requirements-pylint.txt-raw, run "python3 scripts/dev/recompile_requirements.py pylint", and run pylint in a way it only reports your new warning, nothing else (might need to change the config temporarily)
2021-12-02 10:19:02	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: sounds great!
2021-12-02 10:19:35	The-Compiler	(if using tox, make sure to use "tox -e pylint -r" initially so it recreates the env)
2021-12-02 10:20:57	pylbrecht	thanks for the heads-up!
2021-12-02 10:29:45	The-Compiler	ok, after skimming through the changelogs, I see a lot of new gems and optional checkers I want to try
2021-12-02 10:30:34	The-Compiler	thanks for finding this pylbrecht, I had no idea!
2021-12-02 10:36:57	pylbrecht	happy accidents ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
2021-12-02 10:46:39	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: ever seen this before: http://p.cmpl.cc/d03df4da ?
2021-12-02 10:58:22	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: do you have python3.7 in PATH?
2021-12-02 11:01:12	pylbrecht	yes, at least running `python3.7` works fine (using pyenv). I just checked and the /shims/ directory is in PATH.
2021-12-02 11:29:26	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: hm. What happens if you run that command there?   python3.7 -m venv /tmp/somedir
2021-12-02 11:31:06	pylbrecht	unfortunately the same issue: Error: Command '['/tmp/asdfasdfasdf/bin/python3.7', '-Im', 'ensurepip', '--upgrade', '--default-pip']' returned non-zero exit status 1.
2021-12-02 11:31:21	pylbrecht	maybe something's wrong with my pyenv setup..
2021-12-02 11:33:32	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: no more output above it? Not the same error, one level deeper now
2021-12-02 11:34:24	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: could try to run that ensurepip command manually (with the full path to the Python in /tmp there)
2021-12-02 11:43:08	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: yeah, just that one line of output. I will try to run ensurepip manually
2021-12-02 11:43:53	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: ahhh, thanks a lot: ImportError: libffi.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2021-12-02 11:44:16	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: that looks familiar and I will most definitely find something on Google to solve this
2021-12-02 11:45:50	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: thanks for helping me with the steps to solve this!
2021-12-02 11:47:39	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: rebuilding your python should help, needed to do that too after a libffi upgrade recently
2021-12-02 11:50:27	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: that's what stackoverflow suggested as well. And seems to be working
2021-12-02 11:50:50	pylbrecht	thanks again!
2021-12-02 13:37:32	noex	does anyone else experience a bright white flash when switching tabs? if i switch between them, I can get it to stop sometimes, but if I wrap around while switching tabs then they all do it again.
2021-12-02 13:37:49	noex	is my config jacked up?
2021-12-02 13:40:22	arza	that's normal recent qtwebengine behavior
2021-12-02 13:42:51	noex	incredible. really defeats the purpose of "dark mode" when bright white flashes keep blinding you every few seconds.
2021-12-02 13:43:08	noex	it actually gives me headaches and i have to stop browsing because of it
2021-12-02 14:05:19	alpha_Aquilae	hello/ I haven't this behavior with darkmode
2021-12-02 14:06:58	alpha_Aquilae	perhaps try :set colors.webpage.bg black
2021-12-02 14:11:19	alpha_Aquilae	and in personal css : body {background : #000000 ; background-color : #010101}
2021-12-02 14:13:22	alpha_Aquilae	and :set content.user_stylesheets ~/.config/qutebrowser/mystyle.css
2021-12-02 14:41:13	alpha_Aquilae	noex: it's better with that?
2021-12-02 14:43:15	noex	alpha_Aquilae: it appears just setting colors.webpage.bg to black fixes the issue. nice
2021-12-02 14:43:51	alpha_Aquilae	'k ;)
2021-12-02 14:50:13	alpha_Aquilae	you can take back a usual activity...
2021-12-02 14:50:14	alpha_Aquilae	;D
2021-12-02 15:20:53	noex	alpha_Aquilae: you saved me a lot of headache.  quite literally lol
2021-12-02 21:03:07	topcat001	I love the -B (basedir option). Using it to sync my QB state between machines from just one folder.

2021-12-03 14:13:55	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: I already have other issues popping up.. https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/runs/4407995343?check_suite_focus=true
2021-12-03 14:15:06	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: ..and a intimidating deprecation warning https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/runs/4407995021?check_suite_focus=true
2021-12-03 14:17:20	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: fun
2021-12-03 14:19:31	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: for the former, it's because my update also upgraded typing_extensions in pylint requirements, but the your tests requirements have an older version - I'd actually suggest not adding astroid/pylint to the test requirements, and instead adjusting tox.ini to install requirements-pylint.txt for the tests
2021-12-03 14:20:00	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: oh yeah, neat way of solving that. Thanks!
2021-12-03 14:20:39	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: might want to use pytest.importorskip in your test module though, to make things easier for Linux distributions running our testsuite
2021-12-03 14:21:00	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/skipping.html#skipping-on-a-missing-import-dependency
2021-12-03 14:22:17	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: thanks, will look into that after fixing the typing_extensions issue.
2021-12-03 14:24:38	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: looking at the DeprecationWarning
2021-12-03 14:28:06	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: reported it here: https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/issues/1282 - next we should ignore it via "filterwarnings =" in pytest.ini. Add a link to that issue too please, like with the python-hunter thing :)
2021-12-03 14:33:46	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: not sure what you're referring to with "python-hunter", but I will add the link to the issue along with the "filterwarnings =" if that's what you meant?
2021-12-03 14:34:11	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: like here: https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/v2.4.0/pytest.ini#L87
2021-12-03 14:34:20	The-Compiler	so, yes :)
2021-12-03 14:34:37	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: ah, now I get it :)
2021-12-03 14:42:23	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: regarding pytest.importskip, what exact module(s) are you talking about?
2021-12-03 14:42:46	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: astroid and pylint?
2021-12-03 14:52:33	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: and adding pylint requirements to tox.ini did not fix the typing_extensions issue, unfortunately.
2021-12-03 14:53:04	pylbrecht	but maybe I added them to the wrong place?
2021-12-03 15:15:12	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: yep, astroid and pylint, so that distribution tests wanting to install qutebrowser and test their installs don't need to add those as dependencies
2021-12-03 15:20:40	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: sigh, ok, same issue of course even with the split files - though I don't understand where the 4.0.0 is coming from
2021-12-03 15:20:50	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: probably easiest if I just run a dependency update now and then you rebase
2021-12-03 15:22:26	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: that sounds delightful :)
2021-12-03 16:00:07	The-Compiler	pylbrecht: done!

2021-12-03 16:01:38	pylbrecht	The-Compiler: great, thanks! rebased and pushed, let's see if CI is happy.
2021-12-03 16:02:27	rj1	i hope the wayland memory leak issue can be fixed, it cause me much grief

2021-12-03 16:17:07	The-Compiler	rj1: yeah - unlikely to be something qutebrowser can fix, but someone should look into writing a minimal reproducer and reporting it to Qt... toofar, I think you started with something like that, no?

2021-12-03 16:23:25	Foxboron	The-Compiler: Complicated
2021-12-03 16:23:29	The-Compiler	Foxboron: https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html
2021-12-03 16:24:05	Foxboron	The-Compiler: FFY00 is an Arch TU who got engaged in this entire situation and has been trying to figure out a solution for all the distributions.
2021-12-03 16:24:21	Foxboron	He is quoted in that blog article. I have been waiting on them collecting up some notes and new guidelines. Currently it's a mixed bag

2021-12-03 16:28:07	Foxboron	The-Compiler: I think you can. I have used python-build a few places

2021-12-03 16:43:46	The-Compiler	Foxboron: doesn't that introduce a new test dependency though?
2021-12-03 16:44:19	Foxboron	The-Compiler: packaging is default i think?

2021-12-03 20:22:15	thekrak	hey there, open.spotify.com skips 5 songs every time I click play on the webapp (open.spotify.com). Some people had the exact same problem 6 months ago (cf. https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/nx71ug/spotify_skips_exactly_5_songs_then_will_only_load/) but it appeared like 1 week ago for me. Could someone tell me if they can reproduce the bug?
