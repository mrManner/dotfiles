2021-10-13 03:08:07	manicennui	Some used book stores will take them.
2021-10-13 03:08:13	manicennui	Might even pay you a bit.
2021-10-13 03:08:34	manicennui	Several years ago I had to take a bunch of books out to a library in the suburbs.
2021-10-13 03:12:06	plankster	i sold most of my CD collection the other day
2021-10-13 03:12:11	plankster	felt kinda good
2021-10-13 03:12:19	plankster	those were some quality CDs
2021-10-13 03:18:18	manicennui	I got rid of my CD collection years ago, and now I'm slowly rebuilding it.
2021-10-13 03:19:46	plankster	yeah. rebuilding it weirder over here
2021-10-13 03:20:03	plankster	the kinda stuff you cant just find on youtube
2021-10-13 03:21:37	manicennui	I don't get using YT for music.
2021-10-13 03:21:47	manicennui	I'll watch a music video once in a while.
2021-10-13 03:21:51	manicennui	And I have spotify.
2021-10-13 03:22:07	manicennui	But I hate relying on the Internet for such things and kind of like having physical media.
2021-10-13 03:22:23	manicennui	There are also things that are difficult to find outside of import CDs.

2021-10-13 05:44:50	biys	i think it's weird that we still study shakespeare
2021-10-13 05:45:04	biys	it's like suggesting that throughout time there's never been a better writer
2021-10-13 05:45:44	biys	but the thing about that is...  if we're forcing people to study old literature to understand the world, they're understanding of the world will be formulated based on their study of that old literature
2021-10-13 05:47:34	biys	it seems like it's more-so a matter of tradition than anything else at this point
2021-10-13 05:47:43	causative	yes, we study Shakespeare entirely because of social status considerations
2021-10-13 05:47:58	biys	there's certains ideas and concepts that are portrayed that we feel deserve to be discussed
2021-10-13 05:48:21	biys	why?  because they've always been discussed
2021-10-13 05:48:29	causative	he was revered, in the past, so in the present people gain status by saying they study Shakespeare and revering him
2021-10-13 05:48:54	causative	high-status individuals result in others wanting to associate with the high-status individuals, raising their status even more, in a feedback cycle
2021-10-13 05:48:54	biys	that might be part of it
2021-10-13 05:49:14	biys	i would say that instead there's a particular narrative that's being taught
2021-10-13 05:49:18	biys	about how to think about the world
2021-10-13 05:49:20	biys	how to operate in the world
2021-10-13 05:49:48	biys	if everyone reads the same book and is taught to look at it the same way
2021-10-13 05:49:49	biys	well...
2021-10-13 05:49:57	biys	we might as well all just be christians!
2021-10-13 05:50:02	causative	and it helps that Shakespeare's language is now largely inscrutable, or at least difficult to read, for modern students - "if it's hard to understand it must be very important"
2021-10-13 05:51:21	causative	all of this is bullshit, of course. The real merit of a work comes from its content, the claims it makes - not the social reverence surrounding it or the level of inscrutability in it
2021-10-13 05:52:27	biys	sure

2021-10-13 05:54:44	biys	i reject your reality and substitute my own.  it's a conspiracy
2021-10-13 05:56:14	causative	the inscrutability dynamic goes like - "I understand this because I have studied it long and hard. You don't understand it yet. Therefore, your status is lower than mine, and you can aspire to my status by studying this inscrutable work, until you can claim the same as I do."
2021-10-13 05:56:33	causative	it's the same thing that cults do when they reserve sacred mysteries for the higher levels of the cult
2021-10-13 05:56:52	biys	haha
2021-10-13 05:57:08	biys	i like that
2021-10-13 05:58:50	causative	it's legitimate if the thing being understood is designed to be understood easily, and understanding it actually lets you do useful or valuable things that you couldn't do before you understood
2021-10-13 05:58:53	biys	there's more than just reading the text though.  with hamlet i need to understand catholics
2021-10-13 05:59:22	biys	for example, i would have never know what pergatory was had i not read hamlet
2021-10-13 05:59:28	causative	it's illegitimate if the thing being understood is difficult to understand because it uses opaque or archaic language
2021-10-13 05:59:32	biys	actually i didn't know what it was because i read hamlet
2021-10-13 05:59:38	biys	i had to figure out what it was because i read hamlet
2021-10-13 06:05:58	causative	I guess you do learn some things about renaissance Europe if you read Shakespeare
2021-10-13 06:07:26	biys	i wouldn't say only by reading shakespeare
2021-10-13 06:07:33	biys	you'd likely have to read other sources as well
2021-10-13 06:07:54	biys	if you were to simply read shakespeare it is unlikely a person would understand simply with that text

2021-12-02 22:24:50	Franciman	hi all
2021-12-02 22:25:09	Franciman	when they speak about pre-thoretical concepts
2021-12-02 22:25:13	Franciman	what is usually meant?
2021-12-02 22:27:12	goli	thoretical or theoretical?
2021-12-02 22:28:07	Franciman	eheh sorry, typo
2021-12-02 22:28:10	Franciman	theoretical, indeed
2021-12-02 22:28:14	goli	okay
2021-12-02 22:28:19	goli	what do you think?
2021-12-02 22:28:29	goli	its a new question to me
2021-12-02 22:28:44	Franciman	my vague idea is that you are speaking to something that is common knowledge
2021-12-02 22:28:52	Franciman	but has not been philosophically investigated with rigour
2021-12-02 22:28:54	goli	tho am a man of wisdom so i can explain the words as they are
2021-12-02 22:29:10	Franciman	but it does not make much sense
2021-12-02 22:29:10	goli	okay i see
2021-12-02 22:29:14	Franciman	maybe it just means
2021-12-02 22:29:18	Franciman	assumptions of the theory
2021-12-02 22:29:28	Franciman	it surely is something that comes before my theory
2021-12-02 22:29:30	Franciman	:P
2021-12-02 22:29:44	goli	well
2021-12-02 22:29:50	goli	life is a mystery

2021-12-02 22:30:36	goli	or the beyond
2021-12-02 22:31:02	goli	that's how i see pre theory
2021-12-02 22:31:14	goli	theory is what has been put together
2021-12-02 22:31:28	goli	an explanation of an already existing concept
2021-12-02 22:31:39	goli	like the theory of gravity
2021-12-02 22:32:04	I_Am_M00t	life is a mystery
2021-12-02 22:32:09	I_Am_M00t	everyone must stand alone
2021-12-02 22:32:14	goli	the pre-theory of gravity would be gravity itself
2021-12-02 22:32:54	Franciman	so it's like what makes me want to get a theory
2021-12-02 22:32:55	goli	the thing that was already there for the observation to occur
2021-12-02 22:32:57	Franciman	lol

2021-12-02 23:52:52	causative	if you want to know who is in the right in a political struggle, you hardly need to look further than at who is lying and who is telling the truth
2021-12-02 23:53:16	causative	evil goes with lies simply because if evil were honest, it would be seen for what it is and dismantled

2021-12-02 23:55:56	causative	well, are they lying equally and about things of equal importance?

2021-12-03 00:54:01	causative	blame and anger are only meaningful when they are useful, i.e. when blaming someone or punishing them is a good way to reduce the undesired behavior
2021-12-03 00:54:51	causative	if the undesired behavior resulted from lack of knowledge, then granting that knowledge is the right way to correct the behavior
2021-12-03 00:55:22	causative	if the undesired behavior resulted from something they can't change, e.g. a disability, then getting mad will achieve nothing and change nothing

2021-12-03 18:56:50	Delf	I_Am_M00t: But I get to decide too.. so it's majority vote?
2021-12-03 19:00:00	I_Am_M00t	wait, according to my decision only i get to vote
2021-12-03 19:02:09	Delf	hmm... do you not ever need to delegate power of decision?
2021-12-03 19:03:12	I_Am_M00t	i have decided to make that decision when it comes up
2021-12-03 19:03:23	I_Am_M00t	:D
2021-12-03 19:04:11	Delf	Good. That means you're aware that others may have more accurate info and are more suitable for the decision making, given they're not malevolent
2021-12-03 19:04:59	I_Am_M00t	now now, don't reach too far, or i might have to practice democracy
2021-12-03 19:05:38	darklambda	she used to have wings
2021-12-03 19:05:48	darklambda	oh.. sorry.. that was maleficent
2021-12-03 19:06:08	arryana	heya lambda
2021-12-03 19:06:34	darklambda	heya arryana
2021-12-03 19:06:41	arryana	what's the good word
2021-12-03 19:07:43	darklambda	delay... shared about delay pedals in today's learning day... music stuff to non-music audience... and did a demo how the fx was used in u2's 404 song
2021-12-03 19:07:53	darklambda	:-)
2021-12-03 19:08:31	darklambda	what's your good word today? :-)
2021-12-03 19:10:36	arryana	christmas!
2021-12-03 19:11:47	darklambda	oooh... got decors? or food plans?
2021-12-03 19:12:58	I_Am_M00t	deeelaay
2021-12-03 19:13:08	I_Am_M00t	delay delay delay
2021-12-03 19:13:28	darklambda	2nd one is more accurate :-)
2021-12-03 19:13:40	darklambda	they should have called it echo
2021-12-03 19:13:52	darklambda	and attack (in adsr) as delay
2021-12-03 19:14:27	darklambda	oh well.. i wasn't there when they were conceived... i guess i'll just have to roll with it :-P
2021-12-03 19:14:53	I_Am_M00t	heh
2021-12-03 19:15:36	I_Am_M00t	would like a delay where  you can set the number of delays
2021-12-03 19:17:01	darklambda	i think there's a vst for that...
2021-12-03 19:17:11	I_Am_M00t	ye, hmm
2021-12-03 19:17:23	darklambda	up to 8 if i remember correctly
2021-12-03 19:17:57	I_Am_M00t	i tried echoboy, didn't have it
2021-12-03 19:18:12	darklambda	echoboy i want but not free
2021-12-03 19:18:16	I_Am_M00t	there was a number option, but for something else
2021-12-03 19:18:35	darklambda	i used delay from deadduck audio in the demo today
2021-12-03 19:21:25	arryana	both.  decorating, mostly
2021-12-03 19:21:52	darklambda	ooooh.
2021-12-03 19:22:00	darklambda	including your VR space?
2021-12-03 19:22:26	arryana	so far there's only window 'candles' in here
2021-12-03 19:22:38	arryana	but there will probably be a string of christmas lights tomorrow
2021-12-03 19:23:09	darklambda	nice
2021-12-03 19:23:18	arryana	i've still got to go up in the loft for the rest of the things
2021-12-03 19:23:53	causative	Delf, each person has the burden of judging for themselves what is right and what is wrong, what is true and what is false
2021-12-03 19:24:13	causative	they may rely on the judgments of others - but the decision to rely on the judgments of others is also a judgment itself
2021-12-03 19:24:22	causative	ultimately the burden is theirs alone
2021-12-03 19:29:23	darklambda	anthony burden himself when judging food perhaps
2021-12-03 19:35:02	Delf	causative: Damn right
2021-12-03 19:37:37	Delf	Some judge it to be right, to put others at disadvantage and use their lack of understanding against them. What is right/wrong, true/false is not the same as legitimate and not, not when you consider structures of authority.
2021-12-03 19:37:52	causative	but we should not take from this that truth or morality is relative
2021-12-03 19:38:08	causative	our judgment of it is always up to the individual, but the individual can still be right or wrong
2021-12-03 19:38:35	Delf	Can they be right or wrong without any judgment?
2021-12-03 19:38:48	causative	whether they are right or wrong does not depend on what other people think
2021-12-03 19:38:53	causative	it's a question of the actual state of affairs in the world
2021-12-03 19:39:26	Delf	So they're right/wrong according to what?
2021-12-03 19:39:40	causative	according to the world
2021-12-03 19:40:05	Delf	The world!?
2021-12-03 19:40:18	causative	if you think a tree fell, but it did not fall, then you were wrong regardless of how many people agree with you
2021-12-03 19:40:52	causative	the tree itself is what makes you wrong, not other people
2021-12-03 19:40:59	Delf	Ok, not the actual planet but rather the environment, whatever it may be
2021-12-03 19:41:17	darklambda	someone can always twist it to make it right.. like figuratively, etc... :-)
2021-12-03 19:41:41	Delf	That's politics, another subject!
2021-12-03 19:41:47	darklambda	lol
2021-12-03 19:43:03	Delf	That f***ing tree makes me in the wrong, what have I ever done to wrong that tree.
2021-12-03 19:49:45	arryana	that reminds me of a thing, have you seen 'after the dark'
2021-12-03 19:49:46	arryana	?
2021-12-03 19:50:33	arryana	sociologically fascinating film, involving philosophy students
2021-12-03 19:52:56	Delf	causative: It's me making the thinking that it fell that does myself wrong, not the tree. The tree is innocent
2021-12-03 19:52:58	darklambda	i haven't yet.. but thanks for mentioning.. will try to cehck out
2021-12-03 19:53:15	causative	it's the combination of the two, Delf
2021-12-03 19:53:20	causative	the state of affairs and what you think about it
2021-12-03 19:53:27	arryana	it has issues, it isn't a perfect film.  but it's a great spotlight on why philosophers aren't always the best suited to make decisions.
2021-12-03 19:53:31	darklambda	the tree wants you to think that :-P
2021-12-03 19:53:37	darklambda	:-D
2021-12-03 19:53:48	Delf	causative: So the tree being innocent and my lack of accuracy in what I think? I thought only the latter was it, not the former.
2021-12-03 19:54:14	causative	"accuracy" is a relationship between what you think and what is real
2021-12-03 19:54:18	causative	it involves both
2021-12-03 19:54:41	darklambda	what is real? :-)
2021-12-03 19:55:00	Delf	But I must realize that I was in the wrong, otherwise I'll think I'm right
2021-12-03 19:55:22	Delf	And that's something I rather not do
2021-12-03 19:55:57	Delf	The tree will not tell me that I'm wrong, only I can notice it (if I'm unlucky)
2021-12-03 19:56:00	causative	you may think you're right and not be right
2021-12-03 19:56:31	Delf	By that proposition I'm always wrong, no matter what as accuracy will always be short... since there can always be more accuracy
2021-12-03 19:56:56	Delf	Unless I develop rules... that intentionally limit the accuracy as a consequence
2021-12-03 19:57:13	causative	well, that's a different subject, and yes, you're almost always slightly inaccurate, accuracy is usually not a binary thing
2021-12-03 19:57:19	causative	you can be mostly right and slightly wrong
2021-12-03 19:57:33	causative	and you can also *think* you're mostly right, but be mostly wrong
2021-12-03 19:57:34	Delf	So.. less wrong is the ideal, totally right
2021-12-03 19:57:47	arryana	tough question.  i'm not sure there's an easy answer for 'what is real'
2021-12-03 19:57:53	Delf	s/totally/not totally/
2021-12-03 19:57:53	ro-bot-o	Delf meant to say: So.. less wrong is the ideal, not totally right
2021-12-03 19:57:56	darklambda	less wrong.. there's an irc channel for that :-)
2021-12-03 19:58:04	darklambda	join ##lesswrong
2021-12-03 19:58:10	arryana	haha
2021-12-03 19:58:16	darklambda	hmmm..
2021-12-03 19:58:21	darklambda	they haven't migrated?
2021-12-03 19:58:31	darklambda	they used to be in freenode
2021-12-03 19:58:41	darklambda	ah
2021-12-03 19:58:42	arryana	dunno, thought you were kidding
2021-12-03 19:58:45	darklambda	1 hash
2021-12-03 19:58:54	Delf	They were not less wrong enough to migrate
2021-12-03 19:58:57	darklambda	#lesswrong
2021-12-03 19:59:13	darklambda	it's a chat room for rationalists... hehe
2021-12-03 19:59:14	arryana	in my experience, most things are too conditional to be defined that simply
2021-12-03 20:00:57	darklambda	we're humans... and to err is us... hehe
2021-12-03 20:01:31	Delf	causative: If you increase the requirement for accuracy then I'm no good at all
2021-12-03 20:01:48	Delf	So please, don't. It'll make me even less useful
