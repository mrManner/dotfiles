2021-03-11 10:31:44	russ	Morning!
2021-03-11 10:54:17	Carl	Good morning!
2021-03-12 07:42:08	russ	First!
2021-03-12 07:55:30	Edwin	:scream:
2021-03-12 07:55:30	Edwin	:scream:
2021-03-12 10:29:52	tom.lantz	OMG?
2021-03-12 10:30:41	Carl	Are you becoming an early bird @russ? :smile:
2021-03-12 10:31:10	russ	:smile:
2021-03-12 10:31:53	russ	I'm on delivery duty for the next 5 weeks... Wife is doing a work placement. Once a week the youngest starts at 8...
2021-03-12 10:32:08	tom.lantz	The Edwin streak is over
2021-03-12 10:32:36	russ	I may well be a zombie wreck though, and not actually start any productive work until later :grin:
2021-03-12 10:35:08	Edwin	I'll just.. set my alarm to 6AM I guess..
2021-03-12 10:37:00	russ	And on the days I go to bed at 4am... Would that be cheating... Or?
2021-03-12 10:39:04	Edwin	Yes, I think the unwritten rule is that the morning must come at your earliest after waking up
2021-03-12 10:41:24	russ	Pfft. Who hired Mr. Rules over here
2021-03-12 10:42:32	Edwin	Sorry.. can't help it. I'm Dutch.. besides you hired me
2021-03-15 07:13:14	Edwin	Good morning!
2021-03-15 08:59:54	russ	Morning! Got Norwegian language tests all day so might be a bit here and there :tired_face::hear_no_evil: [:muppet_beaker:1]
2021-03-15 09:39:54	Carl	Good morning!
2021-03-15 11:07:48	Carl	Any suggestions on how to fix a Hp laptop that just blinks on the keyboard instead of booting up?
2021-03-15 11:15:35	Edwin	A common problem with Mac Books is that the screen backlight is turned all the way down (turning the light off). Do you have any buttons that control the backlight? If so, can try to turn it up see if that does something.
2021-03-15 11:15:35		Otherwise the second thing to try according to HP is:
2021-03-15 11:15:35		_With the power off and the power cord disconnected, press the Power button on the computer for 5 seconds. The power light indicator, which is on the power button or near it, might turn on briefly but then it goes off._

Haha yes, I wanted to do one simple thing yesterday (log some hours, but pick Edwin as the user) that was not possible, but is a feature in the latest redmine release... So that opened a can of worms which led to the server being updated from Ubuntu 16 to 20 along with PHP, ruby, etc. And finally redmine... [:smile:1 :laughing:1]

2021-04-30 11:03:35		| Wikipedia: Saint Walpurga
2021-04-30 11:03:35		| Saint Walpurga or Walburga (Old English: Wealdburg, Latin: Valpurga, Walpurga, Walpurgis, Swedish: Valborg; c. AD 710 – 25 February 777 or 779), also spelled Valderburg or Guibor, was an Anglo-Saxon missionary to the Frankish Empire. She was canonized on 1 May c. 870 by Pope Adrian II.  Saint Walpurgis Night (or "Sankt Walpurgisnacht") is the name for the eve of her feast day in the Medieval period, which coincided with May Day; her feast is no longer celebrated on that day, but the name is still used for May Eve.

I have two police appointments tomorrow at different times, one for my own citizenship, the other because the kids' passports are about to expire and appointments are rare so gotta take the opportunity! So won't be super available... Back to speed in a couple of days, and planning a couple of Oslo days again next week to get properly caught up. [:+1:1] [ Thread: 3e4 Replies: 6 Subscribed ]

2021-06-09 10:11:18	Edwin	I'll take the rain if you'll take our summer. It's 23C here with a lot of sun (edited)
2021-06-09 10:11:59	Carl	23C doesnt sound too bad? I hope we get a nice summer weather wise this year.
2021-06-09 10:12:21	russ	We had the rain here yesterday
2021-06-09 10:12:55	Edwin	It's not that warm no but the UV index is between 6 and 7 as well which means I smell like sun protect 24/7
2021-06-09 10:14:51	Edwin	But I probably should enjoy this because our new landlord told us the summer in Roros is measured in hours rather than days :joy:
2021-06-09 10:19:51	russ	I don't mind the suncream as long as it's not so hot it stops me from doing certain things... Like going for a run. 20-25 degrees is ok, closer to 30 and I just want to be inside with the a/c while the wife is out at the beach with the kids :smile:
