2021-10-13 00:31:41	b0nn	What's the problem, I doubt that I can help, but ... rubber ducky and all that
2021-10-13 00:33:17	awmv	This repo https://github.com/jfroment/seedbox uses Traefik v2 for a reverse proxy for docker containers. I don't know how to set up my DNS records at Porkbun for this
2021-10-13 00:34:03	awmv	I found this https://go-acme.github.io/lego/dns/porkbun/ but that didn't really help
2021-10-13 00:34:59	b0nn	OIC, you want to set up a "Seed box" on Porkbun?
2021-10-13 00:35:30	awmv	It's just the registrar
2021-10-13 00:35:49	b0nn	I'm not judging, I'm just coming to grips with what you're up to
2021-10-13 00:36:21	b0nn	So, the problem is internal DNS, or DNS that points to the traefik endpoints?
2021-10-13 00:38:42	awmv	I'd think the wildcard DNS that points to traefik? Not really familiar with traefik, though :)

2021-10-13 05:51:20	seebs	i don't know, i have just spent a lot of time recently debugging code which never worked but which had some crazy workarounds "to allow us to test without having to fully instantiate things" and it turns out that those crazy workarounds also happen in real usage sometimes, and at least one of the functions involved *can't work without them*.
2021-10-13 05:51:35	seebs	like, it has a parameter which does not admit any value actually being correct and usable
2021-10-13 05:52:47	b0nn	Your complaint is that its been done badly on your codebase?

2021-10-17 18:32:16	tuskkk____	ok
2021-10-17 18:33:37	fizzie	It'd be normal for the scanner to read some amount of the next line (it's called `bufio` for a reason), and those bytes would even be physically present in the []byte from scanner.Bytes() if you look at the data between len() and cap(), but they certainly shouldn't end up in the output from scanner.Text(), as long as the SplitFunc is written correctly.

2021-10-30 13:37:03	@Sam	Has anyone used cview (fork of the tview UI library that's more idiomatic Go, is actually tested, has a concurrency story, etc.)? At first glance it looks strictly superior, but I haven't interacted with the author or anything and am curious if it holds up or has other issues I'm not aware of yet.

2021-12-02 21:14:09	bpalmer	henko: so if you run it on your machine, it connects successfully; when run on the  company machine, it times out? That sounds like your work probably has limits on outgoing network connections or a firewall
2021-12-02 21:14:49	bpalmer	henko: you'll probably want to check with your work's network administrators and see if you can successfully do this connection "by hand" before you try to automate it
2021-12-02 21:16:33	henko	when running it on my private machine with localhost ist work. when connecting via putty to the machine with IP 1.2.3.4 it works with user+pass (no ssh key). when doing 'go run' with the same program like on my private machine but with localhost exchanged with IP 1.2.3.4. it just timeouts?
2021-12-02 21:16:55	henko	ist = it does
2021-12-02 21:17:19	zsnes	are you expecting go run to somehow know your ssh user/pass?
2021-12-02 21:17:45	zsnes	or to even negotiate ssh for you automatically?

2021-12-02 21:20:39	henko	I just have massive ??? above my head. Why can I connect via putty to the machine flawlessy, but the go program can't?
2021-12-02 21:20:55	henko	It should not be a firewall problem
2021-12-02 21:21:10	henko	and im executing directly in powershell and not WSL2

2021-12-02 21:22:39	henko	and no warnings or errors are displayed in VScode
2021-12-02 21:23:10	bpalmer	I see. Try to capture a trace of the network traffic and see if they're tryin to connect to the same things.

2021-12-02 22:34:19	zsnes	as i recall that makes a fixed size array with the size set to the number of elements you initialized it with.
2021-12-02 22:34:29	bpalmer	yep, array rather than slice.

2021-12-02 22:45:49	bpalmer	but sure, having your package provide the interface that it will be accepting is perfectly reasonable.
2021-12-02 22:47:15	converge	Got it, Im following that principle to keep the interface as small as possible, I only need to use the Do() from http
2021-12-02 22:48:30	converge	My concern is that when the package grows, and has many services, it will have only one service that declares the interface, but it doesnt sound right to choose one of the many services to declare the interface

2021-12-03 02:16:31	LambdaComplex	my gut is saying this was "okay, we have a struct, but now we need to mock it, so we're just gonna define an interface that's identical to all of that struct's methods"
2021-12-03 11:43:16	dalan	`for len(x_array) != 1 && len(y_array) != 1 {  }` in the debug console, I can clearly see `len(x_array)` is `3` and yet my for loop is ending. What am I not seeing?
2021-12-03 11:43:57	dalan	And `len(y_array)` is 1 in this case
2021-12-03 11:44:44	dalan	Basically, I want to stop looping when both lens are 1
2021-12-03 11:50:57	dalan	(Narrator: he needed `||` because that actually makes sense)
2021-12-03 11:53:18	siXy	dalan: for the record, you're almost certainly using slices, not arrays (or len wouldn't make a whole lot of sense...) - and it's good practice not to call slices arrays, or it'll get confusing.
2021-12-03 11:55:30	bookworm	while O agree the amount of times you see an array outside of packet decoding (network, crypto) approaches 0
2021-12-03 11:55:34	bookworm	I*
2021-12-03 11:59:02	dalan	How do I know when I'm using a slice or an array?
2021-12-03 11:59:29	dalan	[]int{1,2,3} is an array?
2021-12-03 11:59:34	gsora	that's a slice
2021-12-03 12:00:06	gsora	[3]int{1,2,3} is an array
2021-12-03 12:00:09	dalan	[3]int{1,2,3}
2021-12-03 12:00:11	dalan	Ahh okay
2021-12-03 12:00:26	gsora	arrays have a fixed size, along other things
2021-12-03 12:00:26	siXy	dalan: And in practice you basically always want a slice.
2021-12-03 12:00:47	gsora	agreed
2021-12-03 12:00:53	siXy	It's fine to keep using them as you have been, just suggesting you use the correct term when referring to them.
2021-12-03 12:01:31	gsora	most obvious limitation of arrays: https://go.dev/play/p/qEcaznTuJBM
2021-12-03 12:05:38	dalan	Is this the optimal way to convert within a slice of a type to another slice of a type? https://go.dev/play/p/sn23ELU1iZH
2021-12-03 12:06:02	dalan	Very much missing list comprehensions
2021-12-03 12:07:13	gsora	you could also do this (minor change, nothing like comprehensions): https://go.dev/play/p/bBqehMdfOk7
2021-12-03 12:07:56	gsora	this way you're specifying the initial len() and cap() of the slice, letting you still use append() instead of specifying indexes to do assignment
2021-12-03 12:08:50	dalan	Isn't that equivalent? In that the append is ultimately just filling the first non-zero space?
2021-12-03 12:08:55	siXy	dalan: You say "optimal", which is a strange thing to use in this context. Do you think that list comprehensions do anything different under the hood? It's more typing, but not any less optimal in memory/compute time/etc.
2021-12-03 12:09:13	dalan	I said optimal, but meant idiomatic âœ¨
2021-12-03 12:09:43	gsora	see it this way: a for{} cycle is usually obvious to the reader, comprehensions not so much :^)
2021-12-03 12:10:34	siXy	*nod* in which case, then yes, your example is fine from that perspective. If you're doing something more than just int -> string there might be better ways, though.
2021-12-03 12:15:44	siXy	dalan: For example, if you have a custom type, and you are just converting to strings so that it can be displayed to humans, you can provide a String() string method, and it'll Just Work(tm): https://go.dev/play/p/_OVfcJWyzlV

2021-12-03 14:30:53	adip	I'm trying to create a copy of a []structs but modifying the copy modifies the original.
2021-12-03 14:31:32	adip	I've tried to use basic = and copy() but I'm still encountering this issue. Is there a proper way to deep copy a slice?
2021-12-03 14:36:41	fizzie	There's no built-in way to make a really "deep" copy. But `make` + `copy` (or the mostly equivalent `append([]T(nil), src...)`) does make a copy of the data that's in the structs, assuming it's a slice of structs and not pointers.

2021-12-03 16:31:33	huoy99	here's a playground example showing the issue: https://go.dev/play/p/usubss4llRi
2021-12-03 16:31:51	huoy99	Cork ^
2021-12-03 16:32:22	fizzie	Don't escape it manually and let the template do it? https://go.dev/play/p/5jxx065phsY
2021-12-03 16:32:40	Cork	huoy99: you need to escape http:// if it is in the query section in an url
2021-12-03 16:32:44	Cork	that is correct
2021-12-03 16:33:22	huoy99	okay that makes sense, thanks fizzie and Cork. i didn't realize that the templates were that smart
2021-12-03 16:33:40	fizzie	huoy99: Or if you have a raw, already-escaped URL from somewhere (rather than you're calling url.QueryEscape), wrap it in the right kind of type: https://go.dev/play/p/GpfbRfXC8FR
2021-12-03 16:34:06	huoy99	yeah i was wondering if it was already encoded, but it isn't
2021-12-03 16:34:43	fizzie	With the caveats at https://pkg.go.dev/html/template#URL -- anything inside the template.URL will be treated as trusted and safe, and included verbatim.
2021-12-03 16:36:39	siXy	huoy99: https://go.dev/play/p/-DwMZYUteah
2021-12-03 16:37:07	siXy	if you provide a template.URL it won't escape it.
2021-12-03 16:37:24	huoy99	actually siXy i'd prefer it escaped but only once. thanks though
2021-12-03 17:49:33	xzr	hey, so there's a library that does "mostly" what I want apart from one function, defined as a part of a struct
2021-12-03 17:50:00	xzr	is there a good method to override that particular function, if you can offer some key words for googling that would be quite helpful
2021-12-03 17:51:56	xzr	My first instinct was to make my own version of the struct, embed the library provided struct and implement my own version of the function in my struct. But I seem to be running into some kind of a problem that when the library code executes it doesn't see the data in my struct (instantiated through make)
2021-12-03 17:59:00	zsnes	make? you shouldn't be using make() to create structures
2021-12-03 17:59:44	zsnes	you should use new() for that
2021-12-03 18:01:01	zsnes	embedding and writing your own method is the way to go for sure, if you need to pass the data to the original method you can do something like: mystruct.EmbeddedTypeName.Method()
2021-12-03 18:01:52	xzr	https://go.dev/play/p/jWntXky3OZX
2021-12-03 18:02:00	xzr	I think this might be nearing to the root of my problem
2021-12-03 18:02:35	xzr	ahh yeah the make is for a map that is part of the library structure
2021-12-03 18:02:56	xzr	sorry for that, I'm slightly wet behind the ears with go still
2021-12-03 18:04:24	xzr	that thing builds if I add the data field to OverrideBuilder but then the data in BaseBuilder that it's functions see isn't initialized
2021-12-03 18:08:16	zsnes	xzr: you have to use the embedded struct to initialize the wrapper struct, ie: &OverrideBuilder{BaseBuilder{data: ....}}
2021-12-03 18:08:42	zsnes	when using a composite literal like that
2021-12-03 18:09:41	xzr	ahh alright I'll give it a spin
2021-12-03 18:10:23	zsnes	you could also assign o := &OverrideBuilder{} then do o.data = make([]byte, 8)
2021-12-03 18:18:37	xzr	I tried that second one and tests fail on "assignment to entry in nil map" as before :/
2021-12-03 18:22:19	seebs	there's no map in your sample code
2021-12-03 18:22:34	seebs	if you are writing to a map, you have to create the map, either with make or an explicit initializer
2021-12-03 18:23:03	seebs	like, there is a line of code in the panic report telling you when you assigned to a map. that map was nil. make it not be nil. :)
2021-12-03 18:23:24	seebs	> My first instinct was to make my own version of the struct, embed the library provided struct and implement my own version of the function in my struct. But I seem to be running into some kind of a problem that when the library code executes it doesn't see the data in my struct (instantiated through make)
2021-12-03 18:23:29	seebs	yes this is normal
2021-12-03 18:23:31	xzr	yeah sorry, it's work code so can't just paste it willy nilly, the example I provided has the make thing which kinda makes it similar :)
2021-12-03 18:23:43	seebs	you may be thinking that embedding is inheritance-like
2021-12-03 18:23:52	xzr	it could be yeah
2021-12-03 18:23:56	seebs	it isn't
2021-12-03 18:24:03	xzr	(my thinking could be)
2021-12-03 18:24:09	xzr	:)
2021-12-03 18:24:15	seebs	so, if you have a struct that has an embedded field, and you call that embedded field's methods, it doesn't get called on your object
2021-12-03 18:24:23	seebs	it gets called on that one embedded field of your object
2021-12-03 18:24:38	seebs	the additional data of your object is not visible or accessible
2021-12-03 18:25:03	seebs	you can sometimes then provide your own method that calls the embedded thing's method, and *your* method will see the stuff, but this only works for some contexts.
2021-12-03 18:25:40	seebs	in particular, it won't work for anything that's operating on the embedded thing and then calling methods. this isn't an inheritance-like thing where they're getting actually-your-object and treating it temporarily as the embedded thing, but you still have your object's method table.
2021-12-03 18:25:46	seebs	they're actually getting the embedded object only.
2021-12-03 18:26:30	seebs	so, in general, you can't really override methods. there's limited cases where you can if what they do is simple and you don't need to deal with other methods working on only the embedded thing, but in general you can't expect it to work.
2021-12-03 18:27:10	xzr	yeah this case isn't particularly simple
2021-12-03 18:27:17	xzr	guess I might have to think of some other workaround
2021-12-03 18:28:23	xzr	the joys of customer having the one obscure use case that none of the available libraries implement without hacking :P
2021-12-03 18:29:24	xzr	but thanks for the help seebs and zsnes, learned another thing at least
2021-12-03 18:39:53	zsnes	xzr: if you give a better example we could probably help suggest something else.
2021-12-03 19:01:42	xzr	zsnes: I think judging by seebs' explanation the kind of overriding I'm looking for in this case it just can't be done
2021-12-03 19:02:02	xzr	so I've kind of reverted to just reimplementing the set of library functionality I need as a separate thing
2021-12-03 19:02:23	xzr	not massive amounts of code so it's kinda fine
2021-12-03 19:05:00	xzr	the problem in this case was the access to the embedded struct's fields
2021-12-03 19:19:15	zsnes	you can access embedded struct fields
2021-12-03 19:19:32	zsnes	https://go.dev/play/p/3dLX1L0CcjA maybe this example will make things more clear
2021-12-03 19:25:29	bpalmer	zsnes: the situation is type A struct { Name string} ; type B struct { *A; Name string } func (a *A) String() string { return a.Name } func main() { b := B{Name: "B"}; fmt.Println(b.String()); }
2021-12-03 19:25:44	bpalmer	https://go.dev/play/p/bAw-tx0Irv3
2021-12-03 19:26:22	bpalmer	where the embedded struct's methods don't access the fields from a struct that it's embedded within
2021-12-03 19:55:10	zsnes	yeah and that makes no sense, so why would yo udo that
2021-12-03 19:55:50	zsnes	you should initialize the Name field in A not duplicate the field in B

2021-12-03 20:50:31	fizzie	There's no syntactical shortcut to call methods on a pointer to an interface, possibly because pointers to interfaces are very unusual.
2021-12-03 20:51:29	fizzie	You would have to write `(*t).MyFunc()` to do the call, though more likely than that the function would instead take a `Test` instead of a `*Test`.
2021-12-03 20:53:34	fizzie	(The type that _implements_ the interface could still be a pointer type, and often is.)
2021-12-03 20:54:03	ldiamond	Ok I'll give that a try
2021-12-03 20:56:09	ldiamond	Yea I'm seeing another issue `cannot call pointer method GetAnnotations on "k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1".ObjectMeta` but if I split it in two lines then it works. Not sure what's happening here.
2021-12-03 21:00:57	rewt	what's the original line, and what did you split it to?

2021-12-03 21:04:07	fizzie	That's probably because the thing you wanted to call it on was a non-pointer value, and unaddressable.
