2021-10-13 03:38:31	nb-ben	there's some chance of information death if it was not sent through the internet. But if it left your router at home, the information is likely to be eternally replicated
2021-10-13 03:38:39	TheGuestMovie	because it brings a LOT of quality-of-life improvements. A fantastic web UI to manage your system with just a few clicks instead of spending a week learning SMB. For example instead of using RAID5, you can use their "SHR1", basically RAID5, but growable, you just insert bigger drives one at a time. Cant do that with mdadm RAID without moving your

2021-10-13 04:27:37	talismanick	and none of the people I do want to try GNU/Linux want to switch because they're afraid

2021-10-13 04:45:57	ornxka	but basically the fundamental problem is that whatever you call via sudo probably has all kinds of features that eventually lead to arbitrary code execution
2021-10-13 04:46:05	[[R]]	Khaytsus: that could be dangerous
2021-10-13 04:46:22	talismanick	Khaytsus: If you're using all of sudo's features, that's fine - they were added for a reason
2021-10-13 04:46:26	ornxka	so if you are relying on sudo to get the property of "run as another user but ONLY the following programs" then you are in for nasty surprises
2021-10-13 04:46:39	talismanick	but it objectively has more vulnerabilities than the alternative

2021-10-13 04:49:37	justsomeguy	There is a noexec option, to prevent fork/exec from the process you launch from sudo.

2021-10-17 20:33:35	HiccupJul	i guess it would be a WM-specific thing rather than a DE-specific thing.
2021-10-17 20:34:41	phogg	HiccupJul: the program which acts as the WM has to maintain its metadata about windows somewhere. To some extent the X server does that, but it probably doesn't track everything the WM knows

2021-10-17 20:36:14	Eryn83FL_Matrix[	hmmm
2021-10-17 20:36:33	HiccupJul	e.g. run that in another terminal and you should get another cinnamon session
2021-10-17 20:36:53	phogg	HiccupJul: C-a-backspace should be avoided! That's X11 auto-zap, which is not only a big kind of hammer, but it can leave your video card in an unstable state and require a reload of the kernel driver (or a reboot) to fix.

2021-10-17 20:37:29	phogg	HiccupJul: your first move should be to kill the WM process (send it SIGTERM), or possibly to just try to SIGHUP it and see if it wakes back up

2021-10-17 20:38:26	HiccupJul	i mean, the freeze is triggered by clicking on an icon in the "quick launch" style bar in the taskbar, but accidentally dragging it
2021-10-17 20:38:39	HiccupJul	so i'm not sure if that would be related to the window manager or not

2021-10-17 20:41:29	hexnewbie	nomagno: DOSEMU and DOSBox offer various degrees of compatibility. DOSBox is tailored towards games, so they would refuse patches regarding e.g. printing support (so little luck with running Word 5.5 which is now free), but there's a fork of DOSemu that uses QEMU, *and* forks with DOSBox with non-gaming features

2021-10-17 21:11:41	SnoopJ	hexnewbie, my approach in Python was to exclude the entire map(s) that I scraped from /proc/ which are already page-aligned AIUI. But yes, I'm just trying to save size here.
2021-10-17 21:11:41	hexnewbie	SnoopJ: Your address is not aligned. So you have half a page. You need to decide do you want to give the same madvise() for the whole page you have a part of, or skip it. Sending one for the whole page may even be problematic.

2021-12-02 00:39:24	xx	maybe I can have the pineapple pieces on the pizza shaped like a penguin
2021-12-02 00:39:33	NyB	xx: I'd suggest not thinking about Linux, and start thinking about the situation your guests will be in...
2021-12-02 00:39:42	MarchHare	ayecee: I'm basically upgrading a 4disk array with 2tb drives to a 4disk array with 4tb drives
2021-12-02 00:39:43	xx	NyB: they be hungry

2021-12-02 00:40:10	NyB	xx: will there be tables, or do you need finger-food?

2021-12-02 01:53:07	NyB	I'd expect gzip to be relatively light on memory bus load. IIRC it does small (<1MiB) blocks, and the dictionary is pretty small too. Would not be surprised if it all fits in L2. And I've seen benchmarks with gzip doing 400MB/s of throughput, which is not a lot reallt

2021-12-02 07:50:17	maxzor_	Do you know of a CLI json viewer, visually in the vein of https://dystroy.org/broot/ or http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/ ?
2021-12-02 07:51:51	mlu	maxzor_: I usually just pass any unformatted json through a beaultifer / checker liks jsonlint
2021-12-02 07:52:25	mlu	maxzor_: I also like to view "prettified" JSON in vim with syntax highlighting
2021-12-02 07:53:37	maxzor_	I am not really looking for a linter alone, more of an interactive viewer which can squash and expand the representation, allow to navigate...
2021-12-02 07:53:55	mlu	ah, that's not possible in CLI
2021-12-02 07:54:02	mlu	unless you meant you want a TUI viewer
2021-12-02 07:54:06	mlu	in which case, I ask the question: why?
2021-12-02 07:54:11	maxzor_	y TUI my bad
2021-12-02 07:54:43	maxzor_	why not? just trying to better view the results of https://github.com/ascent12/drm_info
2021-12-02 07:55:20	maxzor_	or even a kiss gui linux package would do it
2021-12-02 07:56:24	mlu	ah, yeah, the latter :)
2021-12-02 07:56:33	mlu	I personally just inspect my JSON stuff in chrome's dev tools

2021-12-02 07:59:45	mlu	fdan: I personally haven't found the need for much tuning when you can just spin up more backend server instances
2021-12-02 07:59:58	mlu	fdan: that said, you do want to pay attention to the number of file descriptors / resources used per request
2021-12-02 08:00:14	sysRPL	i finally have some encoding setting for obs usb video capture working decently
2021-12-02 08:00:15	mlu	i.e. you want to figure out where your bottlenecks are and provision accordingly
2021-12-02 08:00:23	sysRPL	i still have obscenely large screen record video files, but handbrake can fix that

2021-12-02 08:04:05	fdan	mlu do you think any optimizations to be made at the tcp packet or net or sys or kernel tunables to increase the performance or throughput or latency etc?
2021-12-02 08:04:29	mlu	fdan: more of a networking question, but yeah, you can tune the TCP window, for example
2021-12-02 08:04:52	mlu	fdan: that said, you're in the thousands of simultaneous connections range before you should care about that

2021-12-02 21:08:57	Pazooza	I can print with Linux, just can't set it up nor scan with it since you need smart app to scan.
2021-12-02 21:09:05	Psi-Jack	Gaboradon: Borg Backup, for example, when you do a full system backup, it does all data. When you do a second backup, all the data that's the same is not backed up, but referenced, deduplicating, massively reducing space requirements.
2021-12-02 21:09:30	Guest40	ledeni: all those packages are already installed
2021-12-02 21:09:35	VSpike	All printers after the Laserjet 5 are basically trash :)
2021-12-02 21:09:38	Gaboradon	Psi-Jack, most of the archives will be unique files so this deduplication everyone's hyping so much won't likely be of any effect
2021-12-02 21:09:44	Psi-Jack	But, if the backup origin is Windows, borg may not be viable.
2021-12-02 21:10:14	Psi-Jack	So, why is a filesystem even in the equation?
2021-12-02 21:10:28	dostoyevsky2	Psi-Jack: rsync also only copies the files not already on the backup disk...
2021-12-02 21:11:02	Gaboradon	I could use linux to manage it all, the only issue is hooking up to windows to read it and use the archives when needed, perhaps some samba share or FTP share would work but needs linux in the middle, that would work out I think
2021-12-02 21:11:06	Psi-Jack	dostoyevsky2: To a single storage, no version/revisional history, sure.
2021-12-02 21:11:35	hexnewbie	dostoyevsky2: Deduplication is more than that, though rsync does file-grained deduplication with hardlinks if you tell it

2021-12-03 00:22:29	Dan39	shrinkin is more annoying because you have to make sure you resize the partition to the exact same size you just shrinked the filesystem to, or do what i've done before and shrink it a good bit smaller than i want first, make the partition bigger, than grow it back to the full partition size
2021-12-03 00:23:10	sysRPL	BorgCuba: that was captured from my raspberry pi 3
2021-12-03 00:23:24	Dan39	that's pretty much just for ext3/4 filesystem, i don't think btrfs or xfs support shrinking. actually, i think one of them may have added it very recently, you can check. but anyways, you would have to copy the data off and back on to shrink with most other filesystems
2021-12-03 00:23:43	jcbjoe2021	Dan39: so its better to grow?

2021-12-03 01:16:44	Dan39	thing that really turned me off from discord is when i read about a project's "server" getting shut down without notice when they did nothing wrong
2021-12-03 01:17:05	xx	Dan39: well, channels on irc get shut down too even if they do nothing wrong
2021-12-03 01:17:16	xx	that's why decentralization exists
2021-12-03 01:17:22	midnite	that's a problem with a lot of these big tech companies. google is notorious for locking people out of their accounts and data because their algorithm (in error) thought they were breaking rules
2021-12-03 01:18:03	Dan39	xx: you can host your own irc net pretty easily, and it's usually a more open thing where the net admins let the channels manage themselves except for some extreme scenarios i think

2021-12-03 01:36:20	Gaboradon	Hello
2021-12-03 01:36:23	Dan39	sounds valid to use pywifi, i'd probably just exec out for easy of use in that scenario, but if you want to be more proper pywifi looks nice.
2021-12-03 01:36:56	blipblop	to which i sent the Latitude and longitude of the location and it returns the Weather of that location in JSON
2021-12-03 01:37:06	Dan39	sounds like you just want to view networks around, not use it to connect to a network?

2021-12-03 02:12:30	noahmg123	I'm using GNOME and it seems to now have a hesitancy to raise windows in specific circumstances. If I do a key command to open Chrome Dev Tools on a page that already has such a window open, instead of raising that window, I just get a desktop notification I have to click to raise it
2021-12-03 02:19:20	noahmg123	ok cool, seems to be a wayland issue
2021-12-03 02:34:02	Blondie101010	I have a quite unusual case which I can't even reproduce, but would like if someone has any insight about it...  if I run: `ssh "$server" ps -ef|grep "$processName" |grep -v grep`, it locks up without doing anything but the same command works with any other process and server...  the only particularity is that the "$processName" has about 300 instances...  splitting the command at the first pipe bypasses the weird issue
2021-12-03 02:36:22	xx	`ssh "$server" 'ps -ef|grep "$processName" |grep -v grep'`
2021-12-03 02:36:34	xx	oh, right, $processName
2021-12-03 02:36:50	xx	anyway you have to pass the whole thing over to the ssh server
2021-12-03 02:37:02	Blondie101010	not my question
2021-12-03 02:37:47	Blondie101010	I have not been able to reproduce it with any other process or machine
2021-12-03 02:38:15	Blondie101010	it seems like a buffer issue but I can't seem to pinpoint it
2021-12-03 02:39:41	uwharrie	does `ssh "$server" pgrep "$procesName"` work?
2021-12-03 02:40:17	Blondie101010	I'll try it in a sec, but I'm sure it does...  one minute
2021-12-03 02:42:06	xx	what about `grep "$processName" <(ssh "$server" 'ps -ef') | grep -v grep`
2021-12-03 02:43:40	Blondie101010	yes that does work...
2021-12-03 02:44:05	Blondie101010	actually I made a small mistake in my transcription, and that could possibly provide hints...  the command is ssh "$server" ps -ef|grep "$processName" |grep -qv grep
2021-12-03 02:44:16	Blondie101010	note the -q
2021-12-03 02:45:20	Blondie101010	which obviously causes it to output nothing, which is the same for other checks
2021-12-03 02:45:49	Blondie101010	without the -q it doesn't block
2021-12-03 02:46:55	cbz1ylmMVFsrN58Y	I am trying to send notifications with an action or URL using dunst/notify-send. I've looked at the docs which mention actions, but only how to handle types of clicks, not how to associate an action when sending a notification.
2021-12-03 02:48:07	cbz1ylmMVFsrN58Y	Is it possible to manually add an action/URL to a notification?  You can set the urgency, and on-screen duration, and other parameters such as color info using 'hints', but my searches haven't come up with any way to do it
2021-12-03 02:52:33	Blondie101010	cbz1ylmMVFsrN58Y:  what program does that notification?
2021-12-03 02:53:22	Blondie101010	ah I had missed it
2021-12-03 02:53:25	cbz1ylmMVFsrN58Y	dunst is the notification daemon, notify-send is what I am using to dispatch a notification, eg 'notify-send --urgency low "Title" "Message body"
2021-12-03 02:53:33	Blondie101010	https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/notify-send.1.html
2021-12-03 02:54:16	Blondie101010	short man page that answers you...  yess for the urgency but no it doesn't do any actions
2021-12-03 02:54:50	Blondie101010	but if you can call that, can't you call your own script?
2021-12-03 02:54:54	cbz1ylmMVFsrN58Y	that raises the question, though... how do programs do it?
2021-12-03 02:55:42	cbz1ylmMVFsrN58Y	ie How can a program send a notification with an action, or URL associated to it ( denoted with (A) and (U) in the title, respectively)
2021-12-03 02:56:00	[[R]]	cbz1ylmMVFsrN58Y: find a program that does wht you want, look at how it uses the api, then see how notify-send uses that api
2021-12-03 02:56:43	cbz1ylmMVFsrN58Y	I guess I just gotta wait for a notification that has one lol
2021-12-03 02:57:30	Blondie101010	guess your case is unclear...  didn't you do something to trigger the notification?
2021-12-03 02:58:10	cbz1ylmMVFsrN58Y	I have seen other programs use this feature, but I haven't been able to figure out how to use it in my own scripts and programs

2021-12-03 03:25:44	Gaboradon	NealRame: I did do autojoin in the getgo, I hoped they would auto-sort when conncecting, kinda used to hexchat, but I guess it's useful to do some of my own sorting actually in other cases
2021-12-03 03:26:00	Gaboradon	I'll see if it can be done there, reconnecting
2021-12-03 03:26:07	cbz1ylmMVFsrN58Y	rmaw I've played around with it in a shell, and don't think it's shell, I'm thinking it's specific to the container syntax
2021-12-03 03:26:34	tetrapod	[[R]] I can redact it and post the whole thing if you think that'd help?
2021-12-03 03:26:43	[[R]]	no, it won't help... thats why i asked for it
2021-12-03 03:27:36	tetrapod	Hmm.. I'll figure it out. Thx for the salty replies :)

2021-12-03 04:05:30	shodan45	do usb bluetooth adapters generally just work in linux?
2021-12-03 04:05:47	shodan45	similar to usb audio?
2021-12-03 04:06:12	[[R]]	depends on the device
2021-12-03 04:06:19	[[R]]	just like anythign

2021-12-03 04:06:34	xx	generally they don't in my experience
2021-12-03 04:06:43	xx	you really need to find some that guarantee they work

2021-12-03 04:07:03	hodapp	developed a lot with Bluetooth in prior years, most of the cheap adapters behaved the same and worked fine
2021-12-03 04:07:17	hodapp	however I mostly used the BLE functionality
2021-12-03 04:07:49	shodan45	pci-e any better?
2021-12-03 04:08:18	hodapp	are there pci-e bluetooth adapters? seems a bit silly considering their low bandwidth
2021-12-03 04:08:36	[[R]]	well ther eare mini pcie wifi/bluetooth adapters
2021-12-03 04:08:50	[[R]]	shodan45: the answer is the same as any hardware
2021-12-03 04:08:57	sheep	there are probably regular x1 form factor pcie adapters
2021-12-03 04:23:28	Khaytsus	I just look on amazon for bluetooth linux, can always find what I need

2021-12-03 04:27:46	keir	ZedHedTed: what is this "test"?
2021-12-03 04:28:40	ZedHedTed	i tried pasting some data into #networking but got an error "Cannot send to nick/channel." i'm not muted in there, so it's not that.
2021-12-03 04:28:58	phinxy	I was under the impression a chroot won't edit files on the host but it did for me.  1. mounted /dev/sda1 to /mnt/chroot 2. did a bunch of `mount --rbind  /dev /mnt/chroot/dev` stuff which I dont understand 3. `chroot /mnt/chroot /bin/sh` 4. creating files on /tmp or /home creates the files on host filesystem, too?
2021-12-03 04:29:02	[[R]]	you shouldn't be flooidng channels... so...

2021-12-03 04:29:34	ZedHedTed	[[R]]: it's only 1 line. i'll just take it elsewhere.

2021-12-03 04:30:26	phinxy	https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Chroot contradicts what youre saying with """Feel free to install software, mess with settings, test experimental packages and configurations -- all without having any effect on the main system"""

2021-12-03 04:31:29	catbeard	why with vlc
2021-12-03 04:31:31	ZedHedTed	keir: good idea. that will eliminate the network as the problem.
2021-12-03 04:31:42	Guest14	because x2 and x2+ speeds for listening
2021-12-03 04:31:51	[[R]]	and vlc is the only thing taht does that?
2021-12-03 04:31:52	[[R]]	lol
2021-12-03 04:31:56	Guest14	modern mp3 players usually play at 1x speed

2021-12-03 04:46:22	lockywolf	I.e. when the kernel crashes, it sometimes dumps a block of binary into /var/log/syslog

2021-12-03 04:49:51	sebastorama	keir: sometimes yeah.. I like seeing how other people think and navigate code
2021-12-03 04:49:52	Khaytsus	lockywolf: If your system is dumping _binary_ into text logs, something is seriously wrong.

2021-12-03 04:53:36	[[R]]	well that's an idea
2021-12-03 04:53:44	[[R]]	i was thinking about getting one of those blankets that makes its own heat
2021-12-03 04:54:05	keir	makes its own heat how?
2021-12-03 04:54:07	Khaytsus	[[R]]: Expect to pay more than you expected, and expect them to fail sooner than you expected.

2021-12-03 04:54:57	keir	a heated blanket sounds like a fire hazard
2021-12-03 04:55:06	Khaytsus	Build a man a fire and you keep him warm for a night.  Catch a man on fire and you keep him warm for the rest of his life.

2021-12-03 10:30:42	jim87	Hello! For development reasons, I need to access a cluster which needs to connect back to me. I'm currently under a NAT and thus can't bind on the public IP. I thought I could use a SSH tunnel, but it's not an option here. I was thus considering a VPN approach. I don't need security for this VPN, as it's not open to the net, so a simple PSK should be sufficient. Is there a way to somehow configure the VPN server and thus allow any client connect via a simple
2021-12-03 10:30:42	jim87	bash script with the given IP and PSK? Thanks :)
2021-12-03 10:33:08	Takios	jim87: even if security is not a concern, setting up a wireguard connection is probably still the easiest way currently

2021-12-03 11:09:00	KBar	Hey. What does '\' mean here? history | tail -n1 | sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//'\''
2021-12-03 11:09:14	KBar	Is it a literal '\' or some sed script/extension?
2021-12-03 11:09:54	selckin	so 'f' is the string f, now how do you get a string with ' in it? not ''' syntax error, you escape it '\''
2021-12-03 11:11:55	an3223	err, do any shells support '\'' ? mine dont
2021-12-03 11:12:11	KBar	selckin, okay, we figured the end. What about the beginning of scripts? Right after -e option, there is this '\' that's confusing me
2021-12-03 11:12:31	PaulFertser	I think it means literal \ , then the full s command, then another literal \
2021-12-03 11:12:52	phogg	KBar: you are looking at a shell quoting thing
2021-12-03 11:13:25	PaulFertser	KBar: I copy-pasted your example and it's lacking closing '
2021-12-03 11:13:31	phogg	KBar: in shell everything inside single quotes is literal, so \ is a literal backslash.
2021-12-03 11:13:51	PaulFertser	KBar: I think in the end it was supposed to be ''\' rather than '\''
2021-12-03 11:13:53	KBar	PaulFertser, it's in my .bashrc. alert is alised to
2021-12-03 11:14:23	selckin	KBar: not sure, you have to unescape the shell stuff, then read the sed manual to figure out what that part does, but i fear its part of some double quoted thing that is maybe eval or sourced?
2021-12-03 11:14:28	selckin	and the author should be slapped
2021-12-03 11:14:30	PaulFertser	KBar: so an alias gets eval'd or something, that makes a difference.
2021-12-03 11:14:40	KBar	PaulFertser, alias alert='notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$(history|tail -n1|sed -e '\''s/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//'\'')"'
2021-12-03 11:14:42	phogg	KBar: so you have two cases here: '\' at the start is a literal backslash. Closing the quote and then re-opening it ('\''s...) is doing nothing
2021-12-03 11:15:00	varaindemian	where can I read logs about virtualbox?
2021-12-03 11:15:16	PaulFertser	I also have an alias like that: mpv --no-ytdl $(curl '\''https:// ...
2021-12-03 11:15:17	phogg	KBar: the other one at the end is putting a literal ' into the string. '\'' is the shell-single-quote way to say "put a literal ' into an otherwise single-quoted string"
2021-12-03 11:15:18	selckin	do you have to do shell unescaping twice before it can make sense
2021-12-03 11:15:18	KBar	varaindemian, there is Logs tabs in your VirtualBox manager
2021-12-03 11:15:29	PaulFertser	 | sed '\''s/.*url":"\([^"]*\).*/\1/'\'')'
2021-12-03 11:15:45	phogg	KBar: it is a single quoted string being ended (') then an unquoted, escaped ' (\'), and then a single quoted string being started again.
2021-12-03 11:16:10	phogg	KBar: it is also a mistake, I would say, because that leaves the quoted string open at the end of the line
2021-12-03 11:16:34	PaulFertser	phogg: I think what was missing is information that the whole command we're discussing is _inside single quotes_ already.
2021-12-03 11:16:51	phogg	PaulFertser: that would make it all make more sense
2021-12-03 11:17:13	phogg	in which case both '\'' constructs are injecting a single quote into a single quoted string. Standard shell quoting stuff.
2021-12-03 11:17:25	PaulFertser	So inside single quotes the only way to embed a single quote is to end it, then add \' , then continue with another '
2021-12-03 11:17:28	varaindemian	KBar: right. Can I filter to find what causes the freeze?
2021-12-03 11:17:34	PaulFertser	Yes
2021-12-03 11:18:00	phogg	KBar: This is one of those things which is better done with a shell function to avoid the need to play quoting games
2021-12-03 11:19:21	varaindemian	KBar: I also see 4 log files herel: VBox.log...VBox.log3
2021-12-03 11:19:29	phogg	KBar: this should be the same: alert () { notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([ $? = 0 ] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$(history|tail -n1|sed -e 's/^\s*[0-9]\+\s*//;s/[;&|]\s*alert$//')"; }
2021-12-03 11:24:18	KBar	PaulFertser, exactly. When I run this pipeline, it lacks one closing '. When I add it, it tells me that the command / is unknown. selckin is right, the author should be slapped
2021-12-03 11:24:55	KBar	varaindemian, the one without the number should be the newest/freshest/latest
2021-12-03 11:25:36	KBar	varaindemian, what kind of freezes are you experiencing?
2021-12-03 11:26:14	phogg	KBar: what is this supposed to be doing exactly?
2021-12-03 11:26:24	phogg	KBar: also, did you see my shell function version?
2021-12-03 11:26:39	KBar	phogg, I appreciate your explanation, but this was not my intention. It was right in my .bashrc
2021-12-03 11:26:43	zamba	when performing a NAT prerouting -j DNAT.. then the source ip is "revealed" for the final endpoint?
2021-12-03 11:26:44	phogg	I am also interested in how you are invoking alert. I guess you mean to be doing something like command || alert
2021-12-03 11:26:58	KBar	phogg, notify-send creates a notification with a message and optional icon.
2021-12-03 11:27:06	phogg	KBar: there is no call for using a shell alias for this and many reasons not to
2021-12-03 11:27:17	phogg	KBar: I can see that. What is intended to be in the message?
2021-12-03 11:27:19	KBar	phogg, it's command; alert
2021-12-03 11:27:38	phogg	I am trying to understand why the sed expression is so complicated
2021-12-03 11:27:52	varaindemian	KBar: guess they occur when I copy paste from/to host/guest. The host app where I paste from/to freezes
2021-12-03 11:27:55	PaulFertser	KBar: no, phogg is right, it all makes sense inside a single quoted string, so it's sane for an alias.
2021-12-03 11:27:58	KBar	phogg, well, you can figure it out. The body message contains the last command from .bash_history that was executed
2021-12-03 11:27:59	phogg	looks like you're stripping the leading history number and whitespace out of the history output. Makes sense. But the rest confuses me.
2021-12-03 11:29:06	KBar	varaindemian, make sure your Guest Additions are up to date and match the host version.
2021-12-03 11:29:07	phogg	KBar: does this also do what you want? alert () { local rc=$? last; read last < <(fc -lnr); notify-send --urgency=low -i "$([[ $rc = 0 ]] && echo terminal || echo error)" "$last"; }
2021-12-03 11:30:02	phogg	were you intending maybe to only capture the first command in the line (if there was a pipeline or more than one e.g. 'foo && bar' return only 'foo')?
2021-12-03 11:30:08	varaindemian	KBar: how can I make sure? I alwasy update both the host and the guest (both Ubuntu)
2021-12-03 11:31:21	KBar	varaindemian, just install both either from Ubuntu's official repo or from Oracle's website.
2021-12-03 11:31:50	KBar	they both need to match. Otherwise, I'd say it's probably your hardware's limitations
2021-12-03 11:34:02	KBar	PaulFertser, so \ is just a literal backslash, not some sed command/script that I'm unaware of?
2021-12-03 11:34:37	phogg	KBar: as I said, '\'' is shell-single-quoting for "literal ' inside single quoted string"
2021-12-03 11:34:52	PaulFertser	KBar: no, in your particular example '\'' means 1. terminate the quoted string that was started somewhere before; 2. add literal single quote; 3. Start new single-quoted string
2021-12-03 11:34:58	phogg	echo 'foo'\''bar'
2021-12-03 11:35:55	phogg	echo 'what if you wanted a '\''single quoted'\'' string inside a single quoted string?'
2021-12-03 11:36:20	phogg	given the complexity of the code inside those quotes it's really the best option, but it would be better to use a function to avoid the need to quote at all
2021-12-03 11:36:59	KBar	PaulFertser, and in the beginning it's a literal backslash, correct? sed -e '\''s/...
2021-12-03 11:37:18	PaulFertser	KBar: not correct
2021-12-03 11:38:18	phogg	your whole string on the right hand side of the alias assignment is single quoted...
2021-12-03 11:40:06	phogg	There must be some nicer way to golf that true/false terminal/error ternary.
2021-12-03 11:43:26	phogg	I can get one character shorter this way: alert () { local rc=$? last; read last < <(fc -lnr); notify-send --urgency=low -i "$(! (($rc)) && echo terminal || echo error)" "${last//[&|]*}"; }
2021-12-03 11:43:27	KBar	PaulFertser, ah, I can see that now. too many quotes! thanks for explanation
2021-12-03 11:43:34	phogg	but it's still not nice )-:

2021-12-03 11:44:37	phogg	KBar: do consider the function approach in my example. There are many advantages, not the least of which is that I did everything in-process (all builtins, no external programs)
2021-12-03 11:44:55	phogg	Data909_: might want to do that kind of thing in non-channel buffers
2021-12-03 11:49:36	KBar	PaulFertser, it's broken up into multiple parts, 'notify-send...' + (literal single quote) + 's/...' + (literal single quote) + ')"'
2021-12-03 11:49:37	KBar	closing ) for command substitution earlier, and closing double quote for notify-send's body message
2021-12-03 11:50:06	KBar	did i get it right this time?
2021-12-03 11:50:58	PaulFertser	KBar: yes afaict
2021-12-03 11:51:23	KBar	PaulFertser, awesome. but my brain hurts now. :D
2021-12-03 11:51:27	phogg	yes, everything up to the -e is inside the first quoted string
2021-12-03 11:51:28	KBar	thanks
2021-12-03 11:51:45	phogg	up to and including, plus of course the space after
2021-12-03 11:52:04	phogg	then there are two more quoted strings (the majority of the sed expression being the second)
2021-12-03 11:52:54	phogg	Remember, friends don't let friends use shell aliases!
2021-12-03 11:53:11	phogg	Unless you are abusing shell aliases. That makes you a monster, but your friends should still allow it.
2021-12-03 11:55:17	hemimaniac	Or we abuse yours and then it will give the rest of us plausible deniability
2021-12-03 11:56:04	phogg	The only non-abusive shell alias I still use is alias ls='ls --color=auto'

2021-12-03 12:49:42	PaulFertser	joo-_: regarding tuning the APs, in OpenWrt you can try using DAWN or "usteer" (not yet properly documented but in active development).
2021-12-03 12:49:51	djph	joo-_: with a network analyzer (e.g. wifi analyzer for android), and the AP config screens.

2021-12-03 12:50:13	PaulFertser	But best way is to have your client configured to roam as you see fit of course, to not depend on APs kicking you out.
2021-12-03 12:50:17	djph	joo-_: basically, turn DOWN the transmit power so the APs don't bleed too far into places you don't want them to
2021-12-03 12:50:46	joo-_	djph: well i need to have two access point in my apartment , so when i bring laptop from one place to the other, it should just realize that the old wifi is now very weak and switch to the close one
2021-12-03 12:51:00	joo-_	djph: ah yeah that could maybe be an option
2021-12-03 12:51:28	djph	joo-_: yes, that is how roaming works.  But if AP1 is too high of Tx, if it doesn't fall below your client's roaming threshold, the client isn't gonna move

2021-12-03 12:52:46	djph	joo-_: not really, unfortunately (I mean, it _might_ be doable, but I've never dug that deep into the kernel)
2021-12-03 12:53:11	PaulFertser	djph: roaming threshold should be on wpa_supplicant level, not kernel

2021-12-03 15:15:21	lockywolf	bash+sed+awk+grep
2021-12-03 15:15:41	MrElendig	you can replace all that with just grep, or better, jq
2021-12-03 15:15:52	MrElendig	s/grep/awk/
2021-12-03 15:16:16	MrElendig	if you are using a network manager then you should usually ask it
2021-12-03 15:18:25	hodapp	might be able to find it more explicitly via sysfs or /proc but I forget the details
2021-12-03 15:24:54	rindolf	petaflot: hi,
2021-12-03 15:26:26	rindolf	petaflot: can you try https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-computer-settings/blob/master/shlomif-settings/home-bin-executables/bin/eng-keymap.sh ?
2021-12-03 15:26:53	hongkong_john	since I started using Linux on my laptops I've always used a SWAP partition but I don't think I have ever needed to use it even once. Am I totally misinformed or is it really unnecessary to even have a swap partition for my use case? I just turn my computer off when I'm not using it - I don't see why anyone would even need to hibernate their computer.
2021-12-03 15:27:06	Iarla	How can I grep for a string of unknown length? EG: <a href="...(could be anything..." class="article". Basically, I'm looking for <a of a certain class.
2021-12-03 15:27:46	rindolf	Iarla: https://blog.codinghorror.com/parsing-html-the-cthulhu-way/
2021-12-03 15:27:52	wigums	hongkong_john i dont run swap on ANY of my computers
2021-12-03 15:28:08	wigums	even my 4gb ram laptop
2021-12-03 15:28:13	Iarla	thanks rindolf
2021-12-03 15:29:07	rindolf	Iarla: you're welcome
2021-12-03 15:29:14	wigums	hongkong_john if you find yourself in a position wear you need swap just spin up a temp swap file
2021-12-03 15:29:26	hans	rindolf: that means regex, right?
2021-12-03 15:29:33	hans	haha yeah
2021-12-03 15:29:45	Iarla	rindolf: in my case though, this doesn't apply. The html is malformed apparently. xmllint complains about it.
2021-12-03 15:30:29	rindolf	Iarla: then use a different parser
2021-12-03 15:30:47	hans	html is pretty much always malformed in the wild
2021-12-03 15:30:47	rindolf	or html tidy
2021-12-03 15:31:01	hans	its *rare* to find 100% compliant html
2021-12-03 15:31:24	hans	just head to google.com for some of it (reason: shitty browser backwards compat, at least thats their official version)
2021-12-03 15:32:02	hans	like someone asked some google engineers about it and they said "yeah we need that broken html to properly support some old-ass Opera Mobile browsers"
2021-12-03 15:32:39	rindolf	hans: ouch
2021-12-03 15:33:54	Iarla	I see this in the repo. Is it right? jtidy.noarch : HTML syntax checker and pretty printer
2021-12-03 15:34:36	rindolf	Iarla: no
2021-12-03 15:36:06	Iarla	okay, thanks. I'll add it manually.
2021-12-03 15:36:52	rindolf	Iarla: http://tidy.sourceforge.net/
2021-12-03 15:38:38	rindolf	Iarla: did you try https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ?
2021-12-03 15:40:32	hongkong_john	thanks for the take wigums, that's good advice. Is there any reason everyone seems to recommend setting up a swap so much? For casual users I can't think on any benefit, when I started using linux a few years ago everything I read on installing Arch made out it was SO important so I just did it ever since.
2021-12-03 15:40:37	Iarla	rindolf: ohh, that looks perfect!! Thank you!
2021-12-03 15:41:04	PaulFertser	hongkong_john: swap is needed for suspend-to-disk
2021-12-03 15:41:39	rindolf	Iarla: you're welcome
2021-12-03 15:42:04	wigums	hongkong_john there is absolutly no need for swap unless you hibernate
2021-12-03 15:42:48	wigums	swap is a thing of days gone by
2021-12-03 15:43:03	petaflot	rindolf: same thing ; alt+gr still is [enter] :-/
2021-12-03 15:43:23	rouji	swap is still nice if you don't have boatloads of ram
2021-12-03 15:43:27	acaciause	I think you can hibernate without having swap on all the time even
2021-12-03 15:43:48	lockywolf	hongkong_john, I have swap equal to 2*RAM
2021-12-03 15:44:00	lockywolf	which is 16G
2021-12-03 15:44:06	lockywolf	so 32G swap
2021-12-03 15:44:14	wigums	rouji i dont run swap even on my 4gb ram laptop
2021-12-03 15:44:14	rindolf	petaflot: strange!
2021-12-03 15:44:26	bindi	distros defaulting to 2*ram is fun when you have 96GB ram
2021-12-03 15:44:29	rouji	I have swap on my 32gb desktop and regularly need it
2021-12-03 15:44:44	petaflot	(some) swap is actually really nice _even_ if you have lots of RAM... because if for some reason you run out of memory and have no swap, your computer will just hang. if you have some swap, it will get slow before hanging so this way you have a chance at fixing the OOM issue before it's too late
2021-12-03 15:44:47	lockywolf	on average ~14G is used, and 16G is used for hibernation, and ~2G is for extraordinary circumstances
2021-12-03 15:44:49	wigums	rouji what do you use the swap for?
2021-12-03 15:45:11	rouji	for example so my browser gets pushed there instead of killed when I do something ram intensive
2021-12-03 15:45:14	koollman	computer won't hang, linux will kill some applications
2021-12-03 15:45:17	selckin	petaflot: it won't hang, it'll kill the process suing the most memory, more chance of hanging when using swap with slow disks
2021-12-03 15:45:29	lockywolf	about 6G is used for 3 VMs
2021-12-03 15:46:40	hodapp	petaflot: it'll hit OOM killer first, won't it?
2021-12-03 15:46:56	lockywolf	each having 2G of RAM
2021-12-03 15:46:56	lockywolf	which I use "just sometimes"
2021-12-03 15:46:56	lockywolf	also, most browser tabs are there
2021-12-03 15:46:57	lockywolf	I have ~250 open in all three browsers
2021-12-03 15:47:00	f843d0	koollman: sometimes can even hang, depending on which process is being killed. Some applications have also influence on kernel space, and bugs are a reality everywhere, most of times
2021-12-03 15:47:33	hodapp	it's pretty rare to find something that takes up that much memory in kernel space
2021-12-03 15:47:35	koollman	f843d0: sure. But then if we consider bugs,it can hang while still having ram, or while swapping. not much point discussing that side ;)
2021-12-03 15:47:53	hodapp	and if it's in kernel space, swap also won't help you one bit
2021-12-03 15:48:10	f843d0	koollman: swapping reduces "end of the world scenario"
2021-12-03 15:48:12	hodapp	have only run into that once, and that was on a device with 32 MB RAM and we were doing some code with V4L
2021-12-03 15:48:18	lockywolf	Linux OOM machinery is idiotic
2021-12-03 15:48:19	acaciause	lockywolf: thats a lot of porn tabs right there XD
2021-12-03 15:48:24	koollman	(I do agree that swap is useful, merely pointing out that "computer will just hang" is wrong)
2021-12-03 15:48:35	selckin	swap is ancient, get rid of it
2021-12-03 15:48:39	f843d0	koollman: I'm especially referring to things like ALSA / libasound, GStreamer's buffers, systemd...
2021-12-03 15:48:45	hodapp	f843d0: swapping does absolutely nothing for kernel memory
2021-12-03 15:49:11	koollman	most kernel mem is locked and unswappable, afaik
2021-12-03 15:49:13	f843d0	hodapp: yes, but it prevents killing applications on user space *which can influence kernel space*
2021-12-03 15:49:17	lockywolf	acaciause, you can't even imagine the perversity
2021-12-03 15:49:22	acaciause	haha
2021-12-03 15:49:24	petaflot	hodapp: selckin: cool, it must have changed since last time I ran into the issue then :)
2021-12-03 15:49:57	f843d0	hodapp: like mentioned above, issues like leaking pipelines in GStreamer, stacks of ALSA plugins...
2021-12-03 15:50:48	hodapp	f843d0: uh, if it prevents killing those applications, that would mean *more* kernel memory is used
2021-12-03 15:50:53	koollman	I even prefer having little to no oom-killer acting. disabling overcommit and having some reserved memory. But it's pretty far from a common configuration
2021-12-03 15:52:27	f843d0	hodapp: I never said it reduces kernel memory usage, but prevents weird memory management (weird = buggy)
2021-12-03 15:52:28	koollman	(with vm.admin_reserve_kbytes and vm.overcommit_memory)
2021-12-03 15:53:03	acaciause	koollman: what does the reserved memory do ?
2021-12-03 15:53:30	hodapp	f843d0: not seeing much hard evidence of this besides an indiscriminate "bugs exist"
2021-12-03 15:53:59	koollman	acaciause: basically, allow some memory space allocatable for root-running programs even when memory is tight
2021-12-03 15:54:37	acaciause	koollman: ah thats a good idea actually, never knew that existed
2021-12-03 15:54:42	koollman	acaciause: https://sysctl-explorer.net/vm/admin_reserve_kbytes/ (there is also the same for users, https://sysctl-explorer.net/vm/user_reserve_kbytes/ )
2021-12-03 15:55:17	koollman	it is rarely used, because generally overcommit is enabled anyway, which disable the handling through those
2021-12-03 15:55:57	f843d0	hodapp: well, it's a starting point :)
2021-12-03 15:56:33	koollman	but if you want to have some very predictible behavior,it is interesting to look at those. (and vm.overcommit_memory). And, as a side note, never set vm.overcommit_memory=2 until *after* you raise vm.overcommit_ratio :)
2021-12-03 15:56:34	acaciause	koollman: thats a shame then, I don't see why it should since overcommit ends up being mostly virtual memory
2021-12-03 15:56:52	f843d0	hodapp: anyway, long story short, with some swapping it's less risky that the machine hangs badly on intensive overhead
2021-12-03 15:58:59	acaciause	koollman: I could see it being useful on small vms running microservices or something, so at least you can error out gracefully
2021-12-03 15:59:42	koollman	acaciause: also on large servers running those many small vms
2021-12-03 16:00:06	koollman	acaciause: you don't want some process dying, and don't want to start another vm that will push everyone to swap :)
2021-12-03 16:00:45	acaciause	true
2021-12-03 16:01:06	koollman	(and, in generall for db servers, but not always possible)
2021-12-03 16:01:49	koollman	the nice property is that it allows malloc to actually fail sometimes when memory is tight, before all ram is used. some applications know how to handle that
2021-12-03 16:02:02	hodapp	...by crashing
2021-12-03 16:02:02	koollman	(or they crash, which is also fine, free some memory :) )
2021-12-03 16:02:07	koollman	hodapp: not always :)
2021-12-03 16:02:18	hodapp	koollman: I'm just talking about most of them, not all of them :P
2021-12-03 16:02:21	koollman	or at least, it can be some reasonable crash-handling :)
2021-12-03 16:02:30	hodapp	yes, I know that in C, Rust, and C++ it's possible to use allocators that can fail properly
2021-12-03 16:02:35	koollman	oom-kill can't be handled, in general
2021-12-03 16:02:51	acaciause	I guess to wait for writeback to disk in the case of dbs then so at least you lose less data
2021-12-03 16:03:04	hodapp	is it done with sigkill or something?
2021-12-03 16:03:19	koollman	hodapp: yes. it's a kernell kill, no chance to handle it
2021-12-03 16:03:36	f843d0	hodapp: C should return NULL, C++ I believe suggests going for try catch, Rust I've not played that much yet
2021-12-03 16:03:45	koollman	(beside going with userpace oom-handling, which is a whole different beast)
2021-12-03 16:04:26	hodapp	koollman: does kernel kill differ from other kinds of kill?
2021-12-03 16:05:12	hodapp	f843d0: with C++ it can be pretty complicated because of the number of places a heap allocation can occur
2021-12-03 16:05:24	koollman	hodapp: same idea (probably same code) as sigkill. no handler can be set
2021-12-03 16:05:41	f843d0	hodapp: that's true, I fear that can even happen in STL guys right?
2021-12-03 16:05:48	hodapp	that especially happens in STL
2021-12-03 16:06:21	hodapp	I think with Rust one of the things they had to handle for it to be considered for the kernel is custom allocators but luckily Rust seems to be a bit more explicit about stack vs. heap
2021-12-03 16:06:30	acaciause	well think vectors automagically grow, so it must be mallocing itself.
2021-12-03 16:06:37	koollman	and since it's a kill that can happen anytime, not just when allocating ... it's tricky to write absolutely crash-proof programs
2021-12-03 16:06:57	f843d0	acaciause: realloc-ing themselves most likely
2021-12-03 16:07:18	koollman	(it would still be a requirement for robust applications, but the oom-killer *never* plays nice and will happen at the most unexpected places in code :) )
2021-12-03 16:07:35	hodapp	that's true, I guess the OOM killer sorta runs on the kernel's schedule
2021-12-03 16:07:39	acaciause	f843d0: true
2021-12-03 16:08:22	acaciause	I wonder if you can set a custom allocator in C++ that remaps the standard library allocators to your own one
2021-12-03 16:08:47	hodapp	fairly sure you can for a lot of STL
2021-12-03 16:09:39	MrElendig	lockywolf: ip -j a | jq '.[] | select(.ifname=="<whatever>").addr_info | .[] | select(.scope=="global").local'
2021-12-03 16:10:58	lockywolf	MrElendig, neat!
2021-12-03 16:12:51	MrElendig	add -4 to ip if you only care about v4
2021-12-03 16:13:42	 *	MrElendig also assumes lockywolf only care about global scope addresses
2021-12-03 16:14:04	MrElendig	what you actually want is probably ping though :p
2021-12-03 16:22:02	EtherMan	I have a laptop with an emmc that I’m having a bit of an issue with. Everything works ok, if I first of all set apic=off as a boot param. Until I touch that drive. If I zero out the drive using dd, then after reboot everything is fine, I can create the part table, partitions, format and everything. Up until I install a bootloader. Then suddenly touching the drive in any way, results in kernel soft locking for very long periods. Like, just writing
2021-12-03 16:22:02	EtherMan	a new partition table resulted in 9 watchdog timers triggering (25s each). Actual time elapsed: about 7mins… Now I would sort of assume that means that sector is damaged or something but I can do a full write of zeroes, or full ones and it writes either perfectly, and the bootloader written works, it’s just very VERY slow (takes more than 8h to boot Alpine). If I don’t pass apic=off, it instead hard fails with input output error when it now
2021-12-03 16:22:02	EtherMan	softlocks. Any ideas wth is going on? I’ve run multiple tools that all day the drive and ram are both perfectly ok too so it doesn’t seem to be a hw failure :/
2021-12-03 16:23:31	Dan39	EtherMan: does the laptop only support legacy bios?
2021-12-03 16:24:02	EtherMan	No, UFI as well. It’s just that alpine defaults to syslinux
2021-12-03 16:24:11	EtherMan	Uefi*
2021-12-03 16:25:00	Dan39	i would try with csm off, so uefi only, and try either grub or straight linux efistub
2021-12-03 16:25:13	EtherMan	I suppose I could bypass the need for a bootloader but still something is wrong and I’d like to know what >_<
2021-12-03 16:25:37	Dan39	oh
2021-12-03 16:25:58	Dan39	turn on more verbose loglevel?
2021-12-03 16:26:23	Dan39	taking 8 hours to boot is super excessive haha
2021-12-03 16:26:48	EtherMan	Wasn’t aware that was even possible for the kernel? Boot param I guess?
2021-12-03 16:26:53	Dan39	yes
2021-12-03 16:27:16	Dan39	EtherMan: what tools exactly did you test the drive (emmc, right?) with?
2021-12-03 16:27:41	acaciause	have you tried booting in a different kernel version by the way? maybe a weird firmware bug
2021-12-03 16:27:53	Dan39	good idea
2021-12-03 16:28:26	Dan39	EtherMan: the boot param is literally "loglevel"
2021-12-03 16:29:17	acaciause	EtherMan: is it a chromebook or something by the way?
2021-12-03 16:29:46	EtherMan	Tools used is badblocks, smartctl and Lenovos test system (Lenovo laptop).
2021-12-03 16:30:24	EtherMan	Not a chrome book but same style I guess. Very slim, long battery life. Very low power
2021-12-03 16:31:00	Dan39	EtherMan: you want to make sure you remove the "quiet" boot param if you have it also, and i doubt alpine has it but anything for a boot splash like "splash" or "rhgb"
2021-12-03 16:31:33	Dan39	EtherMan: well i think badblocks does a pretty good test
2021-12-03 16:32:11	EtherMan	And yes I’ve tried different versions, but no real difference other than that if I go back too far, then I lose my wifi and apic=off no longer has any effect for some reason (wifi lost because drivers only came with recent kernels).
2021-12-03 16:32:33	Dan39	EtherMan: did you do a write-mode test with badblocks?
2021-12-03 16:32:40	EtherMan	Yes
2021-12-03 16:32:59	Dan39	could try a different OS
2021-12-03 16:33:02	acaciause	EtherMan: ah nice. I've got a chromebook with custom linux on it installed on the EMMC. Did have some issues with drivers vs kernel version but that was most likely arm/chromebook related
2021-12-03 16:33:05	Dan39	i mean distro
2021-12-03 16:34:04	EtherMan	I have. Same deal on all of them unfortunately. Windows works fine though, but sloooooow.
2021-12-03 16:34:58	acaciause	very strange
2021-12-03 16:35:00	EtherMan	Hmm. Wait. What are these mmcblk0boot0 and mmcblk0boot1? I’ve not created those :/
2021-12-03 16:35:38	Dan39	they are probably some firmware bootloader
2021-12-03 16:35:40	acaciause	UEFI related i think
2021-12-03 16:35:41	Dan39	don't touch
2021-12-03 16:36:12	EtherMan	Right, but mmcblk0 is thr emmc drive.
2021-12-03 16:36:16	Dan39	what is your drive, like mmcblk0p1 and so one?
2021-12-03 16:37:27	PaulFertser	EtherMan: eMMC can have those special "partitions", they're configured inside the chip itself, it's not part of GPT or other schemes.
2021-12-03 16:37:45	EtherMan	Yea, mmcblk0p1 for the EFI drive, and mmcblk0p2 for root is what I generally create now while trying. But right now mmcblk0 doesn’t even have a part table, but I do have those two anyway.
2021-12-03 16:38:17	PaulFertser	EtherMan: most probably those boot0/1 partitions contain initial bootloader.
2021-12-03 16:38:58	EtherMan	PaulFertser: Right, but they’re not mapped anywhere on mmcblk0 or anything? I mean I don’t interfere with them when writing to first sector or anything?
2021-12-03 16:39:04	PaulFertser	EtherMan: yes, you need to repartition mmcblk0 by creating GPT on it, but better do not touch the mmcblkboot* devices
2021-12-03 16:39:47	PaulFertser	EtherMan: more info at https://linux-sunxi.org/Bootable_eMMC
2021-12-03 16:39:56	EtherMan	Just thinking if that’s what’s happening here :/
2021-12-03 16:40:38	PaulFertser	EtherMan: they're separate from the rest of eMMC
2021-12-03 16:42:19	acaciause	EtherMan: when you did your badblocks test, how long did it take to complete?
2021-12-03 16:42:47	EtherMan	About an hour (just 32gigs)
2021-12-03 16:44:06	acaciause	so 8MBs ish
2021-12-03 16:45:00	EtherMan	It’s a very slow drive yes.
2021-12-03 16:45:04	acaciause	I'll try to test it on my chromebook see how fast it is. in theory if its just slow due to a hardware issue it wouldnt show a bad block
2021-12-03 16:45:34	acaciause	probably a hardware issues tbh, they are just glorified SD cards, which are themselves glorified usb sticks XD
2021-12-03 16:46:30	EtherMan	Considering there’s zero expansion options, that would certainly be a very serious bummer if so.
2021-12-03 16:48:00	acaciause	find someone who likes micro-soldering :)
2021-12-03 16:49:02	EtherMan	But we’ll, it’s fully usable if I boot from usb, and the pivot_root to the installed system. I should be able to get it to EFI boot instead and I’ll probably not have any direct issues with it. But it’s annoying knowing there’s an issue that I don’t know why it’s happening >_<
2021-12-03 16:49:46	acaciause	just install bad blocks now on chromebook should get you a speed comparision, only thing I have with emmc
2021-12-03 16:49:56	acaciause	we'll know pretty much for sure then
2021-12-03 16:50:49	acaciause	if your laptop ever used swap its probably why, it burns through SD cards and emmc
2021-12-03 16:51:09	EtherMan	Doesn’t help. I’ve looked at options for expanding ram and putting on the header for a proper m.2 (it’s in the motherboard and even shows as an option in cmos setup), but from what others say, the stuff is all tied down in the firmware so would require hacking that and no one has done that yet as far as Ive found.
2021-12-03 16:52:06	EtherMan	Well ofc it uses swap. It only has 2gigs of ram, and comes with Win10 >_<
2021-12-03 16:52:31	acaciause	I turned it off on chromebook, i saw what it does to my pi's sd cards
2021-12-03 16:52:39	acaciause	preffer OOM killer gets me :)
2021-12-03 16:53:14	EtherMan	Still, it’s only about a year old and Windows works fine on it. And as I said, just avoiding the bootloader makes it perfectly happy :)
2021-12-03 16:53:36	acaciause	fair enough
2021-12-03 17:10:45	EtherMan	Well, added it to the uefi boot and that works fine now. Guess I’ll just have to live with this really annoying feeling of not knowing >_<
2021-12-03 17:21:17	PaulFertser	EtherMan: what is your specific concern?
2021-12-03 17:27:13	EtherMan	Well clearly the kernel shouldn’t soft lock just because of the presence of a bootloader right?
2021-12-03 17:48:35	twainwek	good morning
2021-12-03 17:51:15	DevAntoine	hello there
2021-12-03 17:51:24	DevAntoine	I've stubbled upon a weird condition: https://gist.github.com/devantoine/51143c88db4352e6991a8c2c1695598c
2021-12-03 17:51:52	mawk	can I easily tell linux to ignore one physical ram address?
2021-12-03 17:51:58	mawk	because it's broken
2021-12-03 17:52:09	Kobaz	wiggity weird
2021-12-03 17:52:37	DevAntoine	what's going on with the brackets?
2021-12-03 17:55:13	hodapp	mawk: err, I think you can pass this on kernel command-line
2021-12-03 17:55:25	PaulFertser	mawk: sure https://www.memtest86.com/blacklist-ram-badram-badmemorylist.html#badram
2021-12-03 17:55:40	PaulFertser	mawk: you finally run memtest to figure your btrfs issues?
2021-12-03 17:56:33	pikapika	hey
2021-12-03 17:56:45	pikapika	does anyone know why a live usb would be unable to see the internal disk and ssd
2021-12-03 17:57:01	pikapika	is it a tpm issue
2021-12-03 17:57:16	PaulFertser	pikapika: define "unable to see"
2021-12-03 17:57:27	pikapika	PaulFertser, fdisk does not show it
2021-12-03 17:57:32	pikapika	 /dev/ only has sda
2021-12-03 17:57:33	pikapika	etc
2021-12-03 17:57:35	PaulFertser	pikapika: and the bus that is used to talk to "internal disk and ssd"
2021-12-03 17:57:50	pikapika	the bios listed a sata and another one for the ssd
2021-12-03 17:57:53	uwharrie	does the disk show up in `dmesg` ?
2021-12-03 17:58:18	PaulFertser	pikapika: do you see that sata controller in "lspci -nn"? If yes, is kernel module for it loaded?
2021-12-03 17:58:25	PaulFertser	And what did it say in dmesg?
2021-12-03 17:58:28	mawk	yes PaulFertser and one unlucky physical ram address has a bit flipped
2021-12-03 17:58:31	PaulFertser	(the host controller driver)
2021-12-03 17:58:35	pikapika	What messages would I need to search in dmesg
2021-12-03 17:58:44	mawk	0x444F322F4
2021-12-03 17:58:44	PaulFertser	mawk: was it exposed by the first full pass?
2021-12-03 17:58:56	mawk	no PaulFertser
2021-12-03 17:59:01	mawk	at the second
2021-12-03 17:59:11	mawk	then two more times in that same pass
2021-12-03 17:59:19	PaulFertser	Oh fuck. And how many did you do overall?
2021-12-03 17:59:37	mawk	it's currently doing the third pass, out of projected 4
2021-12-03 17:59:53	PaulFertser	mawk: in any case https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/manual/grub/html_node/badram.html is the answer
2021-12-03 18:00:09	mawk	also it told me "vulnerable to rowhammer" but that's not a problem in regular operation I guess
2021-12-03 18:00:13	mawk	ah nice thanks
2021-12-03 18:01:27	PaulFertser	mawk: I wonder if you ever saw instability due to PSU or the converters on the motherboard failing (without obviously bad caps)?
2021-12-03 18:01:54	PaulFertser	If it ever worth 'scoping the power lines
2021-12-03 18:01:57	mawk	it's a laptop, and it never suddenly shut down no
2021-12-03 18:02:29	mawk	I could try it yes
2021-12-03 18:02:51	mawk	the case has suffered some damage, not many screws hold it now, I should ask for a new case from the builder
2021-12-03 18:04:07	pikapika	I only see something aobut a PCI bridge and some serial bus controllers in lspci PaulFertser
2021-12-03 18:07:43	PaulFertser	pikapika: that's odd. Can you paste it somewhere?
2021-12-03 18:10:48	mawk	I think the command worked
2021-12-03 18:13:07	mawk	actually I don't see the result of it in the e820 map
2021-12-03 18:13:25	mawk	ah yes I see it
2021-12-03 18:13:27	mawk	perfect
2021-12-03 18:13:49	mawk	now my ram stick can roll another year
2021-12-03 18:22:14	tgarder	man I've got a usb hub that starts to shriek after a couple of days. Took me ages to find what emitted the high pitched noise. Must be good.
2021-12-03 18:23:34	pikapika	PaulFertser, its late I'll check it out tomorrow better
2021-12-03 18:23:37	pikapika	thanks for the help
2021-12-03 18:27:42	mawk	if I add a new ram stick then the bad ram address will move around PaulFertser right? I guess I will have to run memtest again
2021-12-03 18:27:58	tesseract	what does companies that use rhel do? do they take compatible hardware and use it 10 years without changing it?
2021-12-03 18:28:38	tesseract	i learnt that rhel doesn't support major release update. so thay stuck with it 10 years?
2021-12-03 18:29:29	PaulFertser	mawk: better safe than sorry
2021-12-03 18:29:44	acaciause	tesseract: yes, because a) people are lazy and b) if its doing something simple there is no need to change it
2021-12-03 18:30:55	acaciause	tesseract: its not law that you cant upgrade it. You can upgrade in place
2021-12-03 18:31:37	tesseract	acaciause: you can't update rhel 7 to 8
2021-12-03 18:31:46	tesseract	you have to reinstall it
2021-12-03 18:32:30	OverCoder	PaulFertser, ah, thanks
2021-12-03 18:32:39	acaciause	tesseract: https://linuxhint.com/upgrade_rhel7_rhel8/
2021-12-03 18:32:46	acaciause	yes you can
2021-12-03 18:33:13	acaciause	and I've done it :)
2021-12-03 18:33:34	tesseract	acaciause: will check
2021-12-03 18:33:52	tesseract	acaciause: do you use it as desktop_?
2021-12-03 18:33:56	tesseract	workstation
2021-12-03 18:34:06	acaciause	no, it was a client's server
2021-12-03 18:34:27	acaciause	not running anything too crazy, simple http service
2021-12-03 18:35:17	acaciause	if you have a complicated setup, you can run into issues. if you go to the Upgrading to RHEL 8 section of that site it shows you where it logs "reasons why you cant upgrade yet"
2021-12-03 18:35:25	acaciause	I didnt have an issue personally
2021-12-03 18:36:22	tesseract	acaciause: but it sounds risky
2021-12-03 18:36:31	tesseract	would companies take that risk?
2021-12-03 18:42:10	acaciause	of course, because they have proper backups
2021-12-03 18:42:51	acaciause	tesseract: I wouldn't touch a machine that isn't backed up properly, or has HA if it needs to be always online.
2021-12-03 18:43:03	acaciause	to do anything with it XD
2021-12-03 18:52:52	tgarder	hehe had to try installing windowmaker again just to see if it would get my juices flowin' for customizing via textfiles again and.. no sadly, no, yikes that felt like ages ago
2021-12-03 18:54:51	tgarder	kinda wish my job involved just having terminal windows open. Then I'd sit in these good old windowmaker style environments forever like Ferdinand, just smelling the roses
2021-12-03 18:57:21	Kremator	good afternoon folks, usually how good is the support of the USB 3-to-HDMI Adapters? because im looking for one (i want 2 monitors, and have only 1 HDMI output from motherboard) and apparently a lot says "not support for MacOS/Linux"
2021-12-03 18:57:55	Kremator	and im wondering if i buy one that doesnt say anything it means it will support linux fine  or if is jsut that the seller doesnt know his stuff
2021-12-03 19:01:24	mawk	now I have to figure out how to do the same badmem thing on windows
2021-12-03 19:13:08	raxor2k	I want to make all my ubuntu server(droplets): https and wws. Is this easy to do?
2021-12-03 19:14:02	[[R]]	raxor2k: you want to do what?
2021-12-03 19:14:36	MrElendig	something 18+ rated probably
2021-12-03 19:15:18	raxor2k	instead of app/APIS connecting to my restApi like: http://ip:port,   i want it to be "https://ip:port,   and the same for the websocket server:  "ws://"   --->   "wss://"
2021-12-03 19:15:25	Guest14	Is this better than wine? https://reactos.org/
2021-12-03 19:15:45	[[R]]	raxor2k: what software are you using that provides the http and websocket ports?
2021-12-03 19:15:55	[[R]]	Guest14: it has nothing to do with wine... or linux
2021-12-03 19:16:05	Guest14	really? How?
2021-12-03 19:16:18	tomreyn	some say beer is better than wine
2021-12-03 19:16:29	MrElendig	raxor2k: run everything behind some proxy like nginx/traefic/caddy/whatever and set up tls in it
2021-12-03 19:16:51	paulcarroty	@Guest14: try it and tell
2021-12-03 19:17:03	MrElendig	apache if you swing that way
2021-12-03 19:17:15	Guest14	Is it not a linux OS since it has OS at the end of react?
2021-12-03 19:17:28	[[R]]	Guest14: go troll somewhere else
2021-12-03 19:17:34	Guest14	im being serious
2021-12-03 19:17:42	[[R]]	"OS" means operating system... again, nothign to do with linux
2021-12-03 19:17:53	Guest14	oh right
2021-12-03 19:25:31	raxor2k	[[R]] / MrElendig : i am running all my apis in docker(restapi , socketserver ) etc.
2021-12-03 19:25:43	raxor2k	do i need to do some configurations in docker rather than the linux server itself then ?
2021-12-03 19:25:58	[[R]]	docker is a container runtime
2021-12-03 19:26:02	ramblebamble	raxor2k, use a reverse proxy
2021-12-03 19:26:03	[[R]]	its not a server providing a port
2021-12-03 19:27:13	ramblebamble	Also raxor2k, since swarm and stack have been deprecated, I am wondering what you are using. rancher tectonic, the thing from hasicorp, kubernetes, you might wanna ask there
2021-12-03 19:28:03	raxor2k	ok so i got the answer then: this i dont set on the server it self but docker. thanks
2021-12-03 19:29:48	MrElendig	you can run the proxy in a container or directly on the host, its up to you
2021-12-03 19:43:33	TheGuestMovie	What's the easiest way for my embedded system to distinguish whether it rebooted due to a kernel panic or whatever else can break a Linux system, or as a planned maintenance operation (invoked from my app, or a user sshing and calling reboot, or whatever).  Basically separating reboots between intentional and unintentional (crashes) when my
2021-12-03 19:43:34	TheGuestMovie	application starts up and writes to its log.
2021-12-03 19:45:38	jim	well the most direct approach, you would write a parser for the log file that shows what might have happened the "last reboot"
2021-12-03 19:53:09	TheGuestMovie	But how would I know what to look for, when there's no exhaustive list of reasons for reboot in journalctl? If I'm relying on the absence of those reasons to detect an unplanned abort (ie poweroff, panic), I gotta look for an indicator of intentional reboot.
2021-12-03 19:54:24	uwharrie	are you running auditd?
2021-12-03 19:55:13	TheGuestMovie	no, never heard of it
2021-12-03 19:55:31	TheGuestMovie	I'll check it out
2021-12-03 19:56:18	TheGuestMovie	nice
2021-12-03 19:59:51	greatcoof	will the metaverse happen? how can we resisit?
2021-12-03 20:01:16	rustytaco	eat both pills.
2021-12-03 20:01:26	koala_man	would you have resisted the world wide web?
2021-12-03 20:02:12	uwharrie	had we known what it would turn in to?
2021-12-03 20:03:13	[[R]]	it's all the WWW's fault linux succeedded
2021-12-03 20:03:16	[[R]]	if not for those darn kids
2021-12-03 20:03:29	uwharrie	stupid apache
2021-12-03 20:07:13	[[R]]	when are they going to rename apache
2021-12-03 20:07:16	[[R]]	it's too offensive
2021-12-03 20:09:10	jim	the default name for the first git branch is probably more offensive (thought they took care of that)
2021-12-03 20:09:34	[[R]]	bunch of pansies

2021-12-03 20:12:46	[[R]]	i once got a carnation for a girl, it was like our 2nd date
2021-12-03 20:12:48	[[R]]	she thought it was a rose
2021-12-03 20:13:17	jim	what color was it?
2021-12-03 20:13:28	[[R]]	red i think
2021-12-03 20:14:10	jim	red means "I luuuuv you"
2021-12-03 20:14:42	jim	so what happened?
2021-12-03 20:15:11	[[R]]	it dindt work out with her, she was strange
2021-12-03 20:15:34	[[R]]	she knew some people i went to school with, a few months later i mentioned her to a friend, and he was like "yeah, you should stay waway from her"
2021-12-03 20:15:35	jim	well how did she respond to the red carnation?
2021-12-03 20:15:35	[[R]]	haha
2021-12-03 20:15:47	[[R]]	she thought it was a rose, i said it was a carnation, and that was that
2021-12-03 20:16:09	jim	so she had no response other than that?
2021-12-03 20:16:25	jim	ok... and, missing info
2021-12-03 20:16:25	[[R]]	i think she said thank yo umaybe
2021-12-03 20:16:27	[[R]]	it was so long ago
2021-12-03 20:16:50	jim	oh ok, so you never found out how she felt about it
2021-12-03 20:16:54	[[R]]	lol
2021-12-03 20:17:07	[[R]]	she it dindt make her drop her panties... lol

2021-12-03 20:50:29	Dreamer409	I've never had much luck with the GUIs for configuring samba. I recommend editing the configuration file. But, maybe someone else has tried one more recently. The problem in the past was the GUI didn't always support the latest versions of samba. Many options weren't available to be edited.
2021-12-03 20:50:45	Dreamer409	Editing the configuration file directly allows you to review all of the configuration.

2021-12-03 20:54:21	PaulFertser	pikapika: of course if your interactive UEFI menu allows to change between some legacy emulation and AHCI mode for the SATA controller it should be set to AHCI, yes.
2021-12-03 20:54:38	PaulFertser	pikapika: raid controller might be using different PCI VID/PID
2021-12-03 20:54:48	PaulFertser	pikapika: but you'd still see that in lspci -nn.
2021-12-03 20:55:20	PaulFertser	pikapika: usually this raid controller thing means you can configure soft-raid from your UEFI menu and then Linux will pick it up.
2021-12-03 20:55:30	Dreamer409	u1: And that's the rub. GUI's are great for some things, not so much others. There are a ton of items in network service configuration, and you're better off learning the configuration files.

2021-12-03 20:56:54	Dreamer409	If you really want to give it a go, I used to use Swat, but it's overkill I think.
2021-12-03 20:57:00	jim	Woodrow, I remember in one program, I was able to define boundaries beyond the default "rectangle", I could add vertexes, and then put an image outside those boundaries
2021-12-03 20:57:04	Woodrow	im ashamed for them
2021-12-03 20:57:12	PaulFertser	pikapika: probably your UEFI somehow disabled the PCI controller altogether because you didn't configure the softraid in it.
2021-12-03 20:57:27	Dreamer409	GAdmin is another.
2021-12-03 20:57:28	u1	Dreamer409: how user is supposed to share files? gnome gui?
2021-12-03 20:57:33	pikapika	Its possible linux does not yet have drivers for it
2021-12-03 20:57:48	u1	Dreamer409: GAdmin doesnt work out of the box
2021-12-03 20:57:48	pikapika	but thats also possible
2021-12-03 20:57:59	pikapika	since its a fresh laptop
2021-12-03 20:58:09	PaulFertser	pikapika: possible, yes, but you'd see it in lspci in this case.
2021-12-03 20:58:34	jim	oh, probably they're proud of how the program turned out... I really don't like folks using shame as a motivator to change their behavior
2021-12-03 20:59:05	jim	so just be aware of that
2021-12-03 20:59:06	u1	Dreamer409: gadmin-samba says smb.conf config mismatch

2021-12-03 20:59:18	Dreamer409	u1: I'm not sure I understand your question. You can set up Samba to share files, and you do that by editing /etc/samba/smb.conf.

2021-12-03 21:00:05	Woodrow	jim if i layed down a wrong image how do i delete it and why doesnt linux give me the option of deleting it?
2021-12-03 21:00:11	Woodrow	i need ease of use

2021-12-03 21:01:01	u1	Dreamer409: for example how to manage samba users? I need to add user user1 to access samba share. How would I do this easily?

2021-12-03 21:02:42	Dreamer409	I've only used Samba in a home environment with share level security, but I believe in your case all Samba users should also have local accounts, and you would set up Samba passwords with smbpasswd
2021-12-03 21:03:02	Dreamer409	As root: smbpasswd -a <username>
2021-12-03 21:03:08	Woodrow	and why dont they allow size to change or have a save? thinking ease of use
2021-12-03 21:03:16	Woodrow	there is no logic these days
2021-12-03 21:03:16	phogg	samba users do not require local accounts, although you can set it up that way
2021-12-03 21:03:34	Dreamer409	Then you would add the user to the list of valid users for a share
2021-12-03 21:03:37	[[R]]	phogg: you're a local account
2021-12-03 21:03:41	u1	Dreamer409: samba-tool user list gives me "Unable to open tdb '/var/lib/samba/private/sam.ldb'"
2021-12-03 21:03:46	phogg	[[R]]: And yet, somehow, I am also a remote account.
2021-12-03 21:03:55	[[R]]	phogg: spooky
2021-12-03 21:03:59	phogg	u1: running it as root?
2021-12-03 21:04:15	Dreamer409	phogg: yeah, I've always preferred share level over user level in a mixed environment. Keep it simple. There's always that one windows box that refuses to play well.
