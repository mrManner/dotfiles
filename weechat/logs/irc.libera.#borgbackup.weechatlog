2021-12-02 09:45:06	adhawkins	Anyone had any contact from Lima at all? I guess they probably have a lot of email to answer...
2021-12-02 09:49:46	tao	not me
2021-12-02 10:05:03	intelfx	not me either
2021-12-02 10:13:15	intelfx	also 1st December came and went and lima is still mostly broken
2021-12-02 10:13:31	intelfx	which means that I'm going to ditch it, sadly
2021-12-02 10:17:31	adhawkins	I've already come to that conclusion sadly. Just one more batch of data to seed up to borgbase then I'm almost certainly done.
2021-12-02 10:17:44	adhawkins	Cancelling the recurring payment could be interesting though.
2021-12-02 10:27:08	elho	broken again, I guess
2021-12-02 10:28:38	elho	my tiny repos did completed their cecks (like 20 mins for 2G repos), a bigger one completed segment check yesterday and since then sits at 0.0% archive check
2021-12-02 10:58:46	adhawkins	I've basically given up accessing them at all elho, except to delete the backups once I've successfully seeded to borgbase.
2021-12-02 10:58:58	adhawkins	Will see what they say if and when I finally get an email.
2021-12-02 11:00:23	elho	why even delete?
2021-12-02 11:00:47	elho	its not as if that was secure anyway
2021-12-02 11:02:22	adhawkins	One reason is that if it comes down to them saying "Well, you've had xTB of data stored here, so we're going to continue charging for that" I don't want them to have that out.
2021-12-02 11:03:01	tao	yeah. i deleted my backups and emailed them to ask them to delete my whole account on both their portal and the sftp server. they haven't replied obviously. but maybe they'll get around to it one day
2021-12-02 11:03:03	elho	I kinda just thought that I am more bothered about the time I wasted re-enabling Lima on the tiny systems and now disabling it again a day fater than I am about the fact that its not working :P
2021-12-02 11:03:23	tao	thankfully they didn't have any of my payment details anyway as i was only using the free trial 25GB
2021-12-02 11:04:15	adhawkins	It's been largely unusable for me since the end of October, and I've been paying them all that time.
2021-12-02 11:05:00	elho	you partly choose to though (like me, but for different reasons)
2021-12-02 11:08:24	tao	i'm wondering if you can talk to the bank and ask them to block transactions from that vendor without needing to replace the entire card
2021-12-02 11:08:41	tao	i'd be doing that and witholding money until they at least replied to you
2021-12-02 11:10:40	elho	block makes no sense IMO.  either you want out, then cancel and be done with it. or if you still want/need your data, the blocking could lead to them deleteing your account and data for not paying and you'd be bummed.
2021-12-02 11:13:15	elho	having the cheap beta rate, having pay 3 months half rate for the first shortish (in comparison to this) problem and somewhat feeling with them for the health issues and most importantly becase it just is that third, kinda archive like, backup copy, I'm holding on for now, but the day I decide to give up, I cancel with the bank and that's all.
2021-12-02 11:14:31	tao	isn't the fear though that they are going to continue to take payment for a service that you can't use and there's no way to stop it if they are not responding to you
2021-12-02 11:15:07	tao	you can't cancel it if they don't respond
2021-12-02 11:15:13	elho	the bank will stop it
2021-12-02 11:15:28	tao	that's what I suggested, asking the bank to stop it :)
2021-12-02 11:24:44	adhawkins	Yeah, I'm hoping it doesn't come to that though.
2021-12-02 11:39:10	elho	oh, I'm now as cursed as you are...
2021-12-02 11:39:21	elho	for the first time I see the SSH login being stuck
2021-12-02 11:58:32	adhawkins	Yay, it's not just me :)
2021-12-02 12:43:58	intelfx	yeah I've saw it a couple times
2021-12-02 12:44:07	intelfx	*I've seen
2021-12-02 12:44:47	intelfx	I wonder what exactly is the failure mode
2021-12-02 12:45:11	intelfx	the interesting tidbit is that invoking statfs on the home directory says it's xfs
2021-12-02 12:45:53	intelfx	which suggests that they may be using ceph as a block storage and mounting xfs on that
2021-12-02 12:46:08	adhawkins	Or the home directories aren't on ceph?
2021-12-02 12:46:19	intelfx	home directory is where you're supposed to keep your stuff
2021-12-02 12:46:28	adhawkins	Ah yes, fair point :)
2021-12-02 12:47:51	intelfx	which, in turn, suggests that file availability might depend on the allocation group
2021-12-02 12:48:19	intelfx	(xfs allocation group)
2021-12-02 12:49:33	intelfx	if it was something like ext4 which keeps metadata in one place, the filesystem would be either wholly inaccessible for metadata ops (if the ceph node that happens to store the inode table has failed) or not
2021-12-02 12:54:30	tao	at the start when the service first launched it was really fast. so whatever has caused it to go wrong has happened later. either more customers on it, or more data being stored on it. either it's just overloaded now with too much, or the chia miners destroyed it and it's never recovered properly
2021-12-02 12:55:29	elho	yeah intelfx, I saw a rbd device once
2021-12-02 12:57:30	elho	and yes, its not entirely dead, the check of my laptop was at 92.x% of the segment check when new logins already got stuck, but now it passed the segment check and is stuck at the archive one
2021-12-02 12:58:46	intelfx	idk, it seems that ceph nodes just die and recover at random
2021-12-02 12:59:13	intelfx	it could be anything, like overloaded network causing health check failures
2021-12-02 12:59:20	elho	there's also that second component to it, not being able to fsync() through to the disk, that was intermittently fine (both, a blatand sync in the shell completing as well as borg being able to write its lock files) but broken again now
2021-12-02 13:00:15	elho	the actual problems could be anything. the going from remarkably fast to hideously slow in general is the customers/load
2021-12-02 13:02:05	tao	it might still have chia on it and they haven't blocked it like they thought. especially when they've been away with broken legs
2021-12-02 13:08:28	 *	elho wonders whether there's a relation between broken legs and unhappy banned CHIA customers ;D
2021-12-02 13:16:28	tao	hah ye

2021-12-03 12:06:04	elho	heh, after Lima SSH login hung for me as well, I did find a terminal with a still open login and did a ls */lock.exclusive which got stuck seemingly forever, too. I kept that window around and by today the ls actually completed :P
2021-12-03 12:12:18	tao	yeah. before I quit it completely I was trying to do a backup and getting frustrated with it and control C'ing it. then 24 hours later I tried running borg break-lock which hung itself
2021-12-03 12:13:05	tao	I suppose break-lock though still needs to load the entire python interpreter and libraries just to delete a file

2021-12-03 13:11:37	elho	I think its rather the lock files itself nowadays. seen borg --version complete fine not too slow but any operation that needs to create the lock (and I assume fsyc() it) be stuck looooooong
2021-12-03 20:17:15	ccf	Ahoj, is is faster and possible to use something else than SSH for a Local-Area-Network backup?

2021-12-03 20:29:28	ToxicFrog	Fastest is going to be running borg on the client machines, rather than mounting them over sshfs
2021-12-03 20:29:42	ToxicFrog	If that's not an option there are some things you can do to make the initial scan faster over sshfs.

2021-12-03 20:31:44	ccf	I once tested to use it "locally" by mounting the destination by NFS. But having two instances of borg (one on the server and one on the client) seems to be faster? About the initial scan, I do not care
2021-12-03 20:39:36	-->	Linkandzelda (LaZ) (~Linkandze@cloudirc.laz.li) has joined #borgbackup
2021-12-03 20:41:26	ToxicFrog	So, two instances of borg are faster because the client instance can do the metadata scan locally, which is much faster, and then for files that have changed, can also do the content scan locally, and send to the server only those blocks that have changed
2021-12-03 20:42:05	ToxicFrog	For network mounts, the metadata scan is much slower, and the default settings for the metadata scan don't actually work well with sshfs (and possibly nfs, less sure about that)
2021-12-03 20:42:20	ToxicFrog	Which results in it regarding every file as "potentially changed" and having to do a content scan on every file as well
2021-12-03 20:42:58	ToxicFrog	Even once you change the settings so that's fixed, it still needs to load the complete contents of every changed file to do the content scan, so a 4GB file containing 1MB of changed data results in 4GB of network traffic rather than 1MB.
2021-12-03 20:44:22	ccf	Cool, thanks for the explanation! So what is the fastest way to backup my data here in my LAN?
2021-12-03 20:45:02	ccf	Is it possible to use something else than openssh that is faster? (could be set by --rsh)
2021-12-03 20:45:19	ToxicFrog	https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/deployment/pull-backup.html#creating-a-backup has some additional details; note in particular the use of --files-cache to change the cache settings (which affects how the metadata scan finds modified files)
2021-12-03 20:45:34	ToxicFrog	Not sure about "something faster than openssh". I haven't tried it on nfs; that might be faster on some setups.
2021-12-03 20:45:37	ToxicFrog	Stuff I have tried:
2021-12-03 20:48:14	ToxicFrog	- borg->borg -- this is fastest, but of course you need borg installed on both ends
2021-12-03 20:48:16	ToxicFrog	- rsync->borg -- i.e. use rsync to copy the files to be backed up to the server, then run borg on that. Also very fast, but requires enough room on the server to keep a complete copy of the dataset being backed up *plus* the borg repo. I use this for backing up some offsite machines that are very slow over sshfs but also very small <8GB each)
2021-12-03 20:48:18	ToxicFrog	- sshfs->borg -- significantly slower, even with appropriate --files-cache settings, and has some gross failure modes if the network goes down or the remote machine goes to sleep; however, works on anything you can ssh into, which is often a virtue (I use this to back up windows machines, small ARM thingies without borg installed, etc)
2021-12-03 20:49:25	ToxicFrog	Other people in this channel may have tried other setups like borg-over-nfs or borg-over-smb, if you want to hang around and see who else chimes in.
