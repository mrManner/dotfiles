2021-12-02 07:52:18	+organizedglobals	Hello again, is there a command I can use to get the geoip location of a doamin or IP address from the command line? I have nslookup and the whois command that i know of, but I've got a domain address whose whois IP is not registered to a location or country. Using `mtr -4 -u -s 1024 -B 256 -i 2 -G 12 -Z 18 -c 200 -b -z` i can see that the traceroute locates it at a datacenter warehouse "fsn1.hetzner.com" which is a service routed from
2021-12-02 07:52:18	+organizedglobals	Frankfurt to 3 different locations in the country, but it doesn't tell me what the physical address is without comparing their various warehouse ping times to the traceroute results, or doing server ping triangulation.
2021-12-02 07:54:35	+organizedglobals	I wouldn't mind a program that has a database of server geolocations, which it then tests various servers to figure out route delay, and thus adjust and triangulate an arbitrarily given server address given that the echo replies are at high priority, or the interface isn't under heavy load.

2021-12-02 14:11:06	+iantucenghi[m]	It does it for you
2021-12-02 14:11:20	+iantucenghi[m]	So yeah a good friend.

2021-12-02 14:11:57	+JamesBelchamber[	*So long as you've added the repos sensibly
2021-12-02 14:12:02	Southern_Gentlem	Salatwurzel, most of the time rpmfusion is ready when upgrades to the next version happens 
2021-12-02 14:12:57	+iantucenghi[m]	Salatwurzel: No worries, Bud. Enjoy.
2021-12-02 14:13:01	+JamesBelchamber[	If you look at the repo config it should have something like `$arch` `$version` in it, which means it'll automatically move to the new repo as you upgrade Fedora
2021-12-02 14:13:02	Southern_Gentlem	JamesBelchamber[, that can be said for any repo you add to be truthful 
2021-12-02 14:13:29	+iantucenghi[m]	Yup

2021-12-02 14:14:16	+iantucenghi[m]	That's the beauty of Fedora. Unlike say Slackware where you have to edit the mirrors file to point to the current version before it can pull packages for that version.

2021-12-02 18:26:01	kjetilho	marloi: the supported method is two at a time.  so dnf system-upgrade to 33, then 35
2021-12-02 18:26:10	kjetilho	but many people think it is safe to jump directly
2021-12-02 18:26:34	Khaytsus	Personally I won't jump more than one a time
2021-12-02 18:26:42	 *	Khaytsus points to https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf-system-upgrade
2021-12-02 18:26:58	Khaytsus	But this is the document.  Follow the entire thing for every upgrade.  Including the "optional" items, they aren't really optional.
2021-12-02 18:27:09	kjetilho	also, you should read the release notes for all of them, ie. for 32 and 33, not just 33 :)
2021-12-02 18:28:20	+Sheogorath[m]	Alternatively: Make a backup of all your stuff, and reinstall a current version. Might be less time consuming than upgrading 4-5 times. Just saying.
2021-12-02 18:29:16	kjetilho	yeah, well - it's not like you have to sit there and watch it ...
2021-12-02 18:30:32	marloi	Hmmm ok. Also almost time for a new laptop, but be safer to just wait for that rather than risk breaking my current setup
2021-12-02 18:31:31	+Sheogorath[m]	No. It would be by no means safer if your device is connected to the internet.

2021-12-02 18:54:01	Khaytsus	billings: huh...  it should always leave rpmorig if the original configuration file was modified.  But there are of course settings around that, maybe only if it's marked as a config file, that I'm not sure of
2021-12-02 18:54:09	billings	I just deployed an updated package that no longer includes a file, and it gets modifed by the user (due to bugs in how NM works, *sigh*) so when the package is updated, RHEL8 doesn't leave any .rpmorig files, but Fedora does
2021-12-02 18:57:03	Khaytsus	Huh, maybe the spec file is different.  That's out of my sphere ;)
2021-12-02 18:57:27	billings	identical packages -- F34 system is installing the RHEL8 package.

2021-12-03 02:24:23	felixphew	hi! does anyone know if dnf system-upgrade ignoring group_package_types is intended behaviour?
2021-12-03 02:24:42	Khaytsus	felixphew: Offhand not sure what that means
2021-12-03 02:25:26	felixphew	I've got a box I'm trying to take from f34 to f35, and even with group_package_types=mandatory it still wants to install systemd-resolved as a "group/module package", even though systemd-resolved is a "default" (not "mandatory") member of group Core
2021-12-03 02:26:34	felixphew	so groups have 3 "tiers" of packages in them: mandatory, default, and optional. the default when installing a group is to install mandatory and default packages, but this can be configured with a dnf option (group_package_types)
2021-12-03 02:27:33	felixphew	dnf system-upgrade likes to install packages that have been newly added to groups (which is good!), but seemingly wants to install newly added default packages even if they wouldn't normally be installed (less good)
2021-12-03 02:34:19	+Sheogorath[m]	Since dnf system-upgrade is a separate package I would argue that the group mechanics weren't considered.
2021-12-03 02:34:29	+Sheogorath[m]	https://dnf-plugins-extras.readthedocs.io/en/latest/system-upgrade.html
2021-12-03 02:35:19	mutk	I am wondering why we would be able to fiddle with groups in an upgrade scenario.  It sounds like a recipe for a broken upgrade.

2021-12-03 02:36:12	Sokel	especially if there are mandatory packages
2021-12-03 02:37:36	felixphew	put it this way: why should a package that (with a particular DNF config) wouldn't be installed with `dnf groupinstall`, be installed with `dnf system-upgrade`?
2021-12-03 02:38:02	mutk	Because an upgrade is necessarily 'everything'
2021-12-03 02:38:16	mutk	A system upgrade
2021-12-03 02:38:21	Sokel	If a group was installed (and is marked as installed) on your system, and there are changes in the next version that adds mandatory packages, they're going to come in.
2021-12-03 02:38:35	mutk	The entirety of the packages provided in the release have been rebased
2021-12-03 02:38:35	felixphew	oh, I agree if there's a new mandatory package
2021-12-03 02:38:43	felixphew	I'm talking about if there's a new _default_ package
2021-12-03 02:39:20	felixphew	e.g. from 34 -> 35, systemd-resolved was added as a default package to @core
2021-12-03 02:39:24	Khaytsus	If you don't want to use resolved, you don't have to, but going out of your way avoiding it is kind of silly.
2021-12-03 02:39:30	Sokel	I don't see the problem.
2021-12-03 02:39:56	felixphew	I'm not particularly concerned about resolved, this is just the example with which I found what sounds to me like a (admittedly super minor) bug
2021-12-03 02:41:03	mutk	If you are doing a system upgrade, there will be changed packages regardless of group 'status'
2021-12-03 02:41:44	felixphew	yes, I understand that; please don't think I'm here trying to complain that upgrade is "installing too much stuff" or anything like that
2021-12-03 02:41:48	mutk	I would say group status is not even relevent during a system upgrade. Within the life of an installed release sure.
2021-12-03 02:42:50	felixphew	by what logic is it not relevant? the upgrade process is definitely aware of groups as it tracks and installs new group packages

2021-12-03 07:32:41	gour	morning
2021-12-03 07:33:55	rindolf	gour: hey
2021-12-03 07:33:59	gour	i recently switched from debian to fc35 and would like to have of en_GB/hr_HR locales
2021-12-03 07:34:27	gour	i've the following in my locale.conf: LANG=hr_HR.UTF-8 and LC_MESSAGES=en_GB.UTF-8
2021-12-03 07:35:01	gour	but hr_HR setting is not honoured which was working under debian, so wonder what else do i need?
2021-12-03 07:35:13	 *	gour is using xfce spin
2021-12-03 07:37:53	rindolf	gour: try https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/rawhide/system-administrators-guide/basic-system-configuration/System_Locale_and_Keyboard_Configuration/
2021-12-03 07:41:36	gour	@rindolf: i read it and put appropriate entries...now tried to change xfce's language settings
2021-12-03 07:41:40	gour	let's see
2021-12-03 07:50:25	gour	despite setting Croatian (in xfce) as system language and having hr_HR.UTF-8 in locale.conf, 'locales' still does show en_GB :-/
2021-12-03 07:57:58	gour	changing the language in lightdm screen, helped :-)
2021-12-03 08:01:59	rindolf	gour: great!
2021-12-03 08:17:28	gour	btw, am right there is no dedicated channel for xfce spin?
2021-12-03 08:24:40	rindolf	gour: don't know, and see https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=joel-diary-2-Sep-2004--1
2021-12-03 08:31:17	 *	gour nods
2021-12-03 08:40:57	ledeni	gour: did you install xfce4-xkb-plugin
2021-12-03 08:42:33	gour	ledeni: yes, it's installed...i solved the problem
2021-12-03 08:42:55	gour	😄
2021-12-03 08:44:14	ledeni	gour, great 👍 
2021-12-03 08:46:45	gour	everything else works beautifully...and no need to dance on Debian's unstable (sid) to have fresh packages 😉

2021-12-03 10:59:39	mr4braham	I need help with snapshot rollback
2021-12-03 11:00:29	mr4braham	My laptop crashed while running dnf update, I had to do a force reset, now when I turn it on again it takes me to the maintenance shell
2021-12-03 11:01:32	mr4braham	I had snapper installed doing snapshots every dnf transaction, so what I want to do is restore the os to the snapshot pre sudo dnf update
2021-12-03 11:03:03	mr4braham	How can I do that? I booted from a live fedora stick and mounted my ssd but the .snapshots subvolume inside the root folder is locked, I cannot access it for some reason, and even if I could I don't know how I would be able to rollback to the snapshots in there.
2021-12-03 11:03:08	mr4braham	Someone help pls
2021-12-03 11:03:23	[Enrico]	mr4braham: with btrfs should be simple enough, you can create a RW snapshot of the snapshot you want to restore (so you still have a copy if the first try fails). Rename your / subvolume to something else, then rename your RW snapshot to the same name your root volume had before. That's it. Of course if you have other system folders, such as /var in a different volume you have to do the same for all of them
2021-12-03 11:03:52	[Enrico]	.snapshots folder locked? How so?
2021-12-03 11:05:10	mr4braham	So when I try acessing the .snapshots with the file manager the folder has a lock and gives me an error when I try to access, doing it through the terminal it does not give me any errors but it does not go to the folder, simply stays at the current folder
2021-12-03 11:06:06	mr4braham	The laptop ssd is encrypted, I am decrypting before mounting
2021-12-03 11:06:41	[Enrico]	mr4braham: so you type cd .snapshots , it doesn't give any error, but it doesn't go in there? You might have a corrupted file system I suppose
2021-12-03 11:08:36	mr4braham	Nevermind it was a dumb thing
2021-12-03 11:08:38	mr4braham	permissions
2021-12-03 11:08:53	[Enrico]	well you might need to be root indeed
2021-12-03 11:11:18	mr4braham	Thanks for pointing me in the right directions, I will google how to create the rw copy, if I run into trouble I will come back here

2021-12-03 15:40:42	jlabarre-rh	an odd situation with a F35 install here.  On a Lenovo H515, I've twice installed Fedora (F34 upgraded to F35 on older HDD, and F35 on a brand-new SSD).  These work fine for a few days, but then I'll find the system suddenly can't find an OS on the disks (I'll have the system shut off for a day or two)
2021-12-03 15:41:45	jlabarre-rh	if I put the SSD into another machine (thinkpad T430 in this case) the system boots and runs the OS from the disk without any modifications needed (no rescue steps, etc)
2021-12-03 15:43:15	jlabarre-rh	I can mount the HDD and SSD (formatted with the default BTRFS install, root disabled) and read/write with no problem.
2021-12-03 15:46:10	jlabarre-rh	the next thing I wanted to try was to bring the H515 up in "rescue" mode and see if I could re-write the bootloader (perhaps not visible to that particular system, even if otherwise available, but the regular "rescue" boot says it can't because root is locked
2021-12-03 15:51:06	jlabarre-rh	ultimately I'm trying to determine two things here 1: I haven't found documentation on rescue procedure for F35, so I figure I should write it up myself and 2: is this failure a bug in Fedora, or just bad HW.
2021-12-03 16:00:08	ledeni	jlabarre-rh: did you try to turn off old hdd and boot f35 from sdd on H515
2021-12-03 16:01:15	jlabarre-rh	I removed the HDD and had done a fresh install on the SSD (there aren't enough SATA & power connections to have more than one "hard drive"
2021-12-03 16:04:35	ledeni	jlabarre-rh: and hdd & sdd systems drop to rescue shell 
2021-12-03 16:06:28	jlabarre-rh	no, I have to boot from a Fedora live DVD, booting from the HDD or SSD gives a "Error 1962: no operating system found"
2021-12-03 16:07:49	apollo13	jlabarre-rh: I assume that this is an uefi based system?
2021-12-03 16:08:54	jlabarre-rh	yes, I've tried setting it for "legacy only" and "UEFI only" (it's default is "Auto") to see if that got out of sync
2021-12-03 16:09:38	apollo13	well if it is uefi you might have to need to recreate the boot entries after swapping disks
2021-12-03 16:10:39	apollo13	from what you said it might be that the bios battery is empty
2021-12-03 16:10:58	apollo13	which may (or may not) wipe boot entries
2021-12-03 16:11:37	jlabarre-rh	new 2032 installed (actually changed twice, just in case the ones I have on hand have expired)
2021-12-03 16:12:02	apollo13	but after changing the boot entries will still be gone and you might need to manually recreate them
2021-12-03 16:12:30	jlabarre-rh	the machine had been sitting in storage 2 or 3 years, so I changed the battery first thing before installing.
2021-12-03 16:13:06	jlabarre-rh	although if the replacement one had already expired, it might have lost EFI anyway
2021-12-03 16:14:13	apollo13	yeah, I mean I honestly doubt that the disks have a problem especially if they work in another pc. I mean the connector might have broken down as well, but dunno…
2021-12-03 16:14:29	apollo13	I'd drop into a uefi shell and see if you can start the system from there
2021-12-03 16:16:14	jlabarre-rh	now that's interesting, I had done an install on another SSD yesterday (this is after the second battery), and swapping it in today it's already not seeing the boot sector
2021-12-03 16:16:34	apollo13	oi
2021-12-03 16:17:33	jlabarre-rh	have to find how to get this to go into EFI shell, as it's not on it's regular boot options (or in the "BIOS" screens either)
2021-12-03 16:18:41	jlabarre-rh	this machine isn't one of Lenovo's best efforts.  But I figured it might at least make a useful test platform (which it looks like it kind of is, unintentionally)
2021-12-03 16:18:58	apollo13	:D
2021-12-03 16:34:10	Southern_Gentlem	jlabarre-rh, most machines its f8
2021-12-03 16:35:04	jlabarre-rh	yeah, but not working here
2021-12-03 16:35:31	ledeni	jlabarre-rh: intersting I have one old asus laptop and when i took hdd i had lost boot and i find way to solve it. I boot supergrub2 usb that find boot(grub) .Once i bootup system run sudo efibootmgr -b 0000 -B & sudo efibootmgr -c -w -L Fedora -d /dev/sda -p 1 -l \\EFI\\fedora\\shimx64.efi  
2021-12-03 16:35:53	farchord	Good morning, ladies, gents and people of unspecified genders! Question for you all; I just migrated from Manjaro to Fedora. I'm working on getting everything working as I want, one little thing that seems to not work is Google Chrome's Hardware Video Decoding support. I copied my chrome flags from Manjaro, made sure that GPU blacklist is disabled, and even with that, video decode is still disabled. Using a 
2021-12-03 16:35:54	farchord	3070ti, libva/vdpauinfo is installed, as well as the akmod-nvidia drivers.
2021-12-03 16:42:29	Southern_Gentlem	farchord, did you try the commonbugs in the channel topic
2021-12-03 16:43:30	farchord	Nope I have not, let me see those
2021-12-03 16:47:45	farchord	@Southern_Gentlem, I don't think none of those apply to me. The only one I thought *might* apply is the sound one, but nah sound works here
2021-12-03 16:51:30	charcoal	upgrade question. i'm doing f33->f35. command is "dnf -y system-upgrade download --no-downgrade --allowerasing --noautoremove --downloaddir=/home/tmp/fedup --releasever 35". after removing some conflicting packages, it's no longer complaining of various incompatibilities. fine so far.
2021-12-03 16:51:37	charcoal	however, looking in the download directory, i do not find (e.g.) python3-3.10-whatever, even though it obviously needs to upgrade, and several incompats for it had to be removed. am i missing something?
2021-12-03 17:00:56	Khaytsus	charcoal: Why are you passing all those flags?
2021-12-03 17:01:00	 *	Khaytsus points to https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf-system-upgrade
2021-12-03 17:01:23	Khaytsus	If you can't use defaults, post the reason why and we can help you figure it out.
2021-12-03 17:01:39	Khaytsus	Adding every possible flag known to man is often a problem where just defaults work fine
2021-12-03 17:02:59	Khaytsus	Specifically, why no downgrade....  allowerasing shouldn't normally be needed either.  I owuld never do -y on such an operation either.
2021-12-03 17:09:38	+Astarael[m]	yep one of the reasons I like Fedora for that they don't enable `y` as default
2021-12-03 17:10:52	farchord	@Southern_Gentlem, Found the problem. Seems Google Chrome in Fedora ignores the chrome-flags.conf file in .config. Had to edit the .desktop file in /usr/share/applications
2021-12-03 17:11:45	Khaytsus	farchord: Except Fedora doesn't ship Chrome, so
2021-12-03 17:12:11	charcoal	i use flags like that because when i use the simple command for defaults i get: "Error:  Problem: The operation would result in removing the following protected packages: gnome-shell (try to add '--allowerasing' to command line to replace conflicting packages or '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages)"
2021-12-03 17:12:42	Khaytsus	charcoal: And that sounds like a mess, again, post it to a pastebin..  use fpaste or whatnot
2021-12-03 17:12:46	Southern_Gentlem	remove the noautoremove 
2021-12-03 17:13:01	farchord	@Khaytsus, no worries :)

2021-12-03 17:50:25	choirboy	I have a ThinkPad W541. Using a corded headset with mic, I am getting a terrible static noise when recording audio. ISTR there is some change I need to do after upgrading from F34 to F35 as regards to the audio subsystem, like maybe convert to the new subsystem. Does that ring any bells for anyone?
2021-12-03 17:58:05	rindolf	choirboy: pipewire?
2021-12-03 18:00:34	jlabarre-rh	got it to boot to the installed system with the supergrub2 CD, and in addition to the efibootmgr commands, I also added rEFInd Boot Manager (maybe if the system loses it's Fedora boot I can still recover it there)
2021-12-03 18:02:13	choirboy	rindolf ISTR that, if you upgraded from a pulse based system (like F33 or F34) to F35, you have to convert the system to using pipewire. But I can't find anything about it with my weak Google-foo.
2021-12-03 18:06:50	+thm[m]	choirboy: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2016253
2021-12-03 18:10:02	choirboy	thm[m] I don't think that's it, I have audio. Just that the input is corrupted, it just records static
2021-12-03 18:11:20	+thm[m]	You might have a "mixed" setup, try `sudo dnf swap --allowerasing pulseaudio pipewire-pulseaudio` (mentioned later in that bug)
2021-12-03 18:23:29	choirboy	thm[m] thanks, I appreciate it. That wasn't it. I'm gonna reboot into another OS and make sure this is not a hardware issue

2021-12-03 19:33:00	nukke	having issues with getting anything *but* HSP audio on a bluetooth headset. I'm on Fedora 35 KDE spin, latest kernel and using pipewire. this is on a laptop w/ an Intel AX200NGW (with Bluetooth 5.1), and the headphones in question are the Sony WH-1000XM4
2021-12-03 19:34:49	nukke	I've tried copying the `bluez-monitor.conf` file from `/etc` over to `~/.config/pipewire/media-session` and uncommenting the lines with the list of codecs. I've installed `pavucontrol` and all the "High Fidelity Playback" options (aptX, LDAC, AAC, ...) options are shown as "unavailable". 
2021-12-03 19:38:54	nukke	forgot to mention that I also did install the `bluetooth-freeworld` package from RPMFusion (`pulseaudio-module-bluetooth-freeworld-1.4-8.fc35.x86_64`)
2021-12-03 20:01:50	nukke	I also just tried adding `Disable=Headset` at the end of the `/etc/bluetooth/main.conf` file and rebooted. I reconnected the headphones after rebooting and it's still defaulting to HSP with all other options showing as "unavailable"

2021-12-03 20:52:51	farchord	@allenwrench[m], regrets? Hmmm, good question... For the record, I just switched to Fedora this morning, I was on Manjaro for a month and a half. But the only thing I kinda miss would be it's cohesiveness, and the fact the interface hasn't changed in years. If you need to make something work, if it's possible, it's extremely well documented everywhere on the net.
2021-12-03 20:53:17	farchord	On Linux, it's documented... but the ways changed over the years, or it's not properly documented. The information is so abundant that it's highly confusing
