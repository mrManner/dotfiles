This doesn't really fit your use-case anyway, but it's something to be aware of if someone wants to start putting those kinds of questions on the forms - then it's best to use the "group member question" form instead and link that - because those questions "live" on the target project, they are not copies.

This doesn't really fit your use-case anyway, but it's something to be aware of if someone wants to start putting those kinds of questions on the forms - then it's best to use the "group member question" form instead and link that - because those questions "live" on the target project, they are not copies.

This doesn't really fit your use-case anyway, but it's something to be aware of if someone wants to start putting those kinds of questions on the forms - then it's best to use the "group member question" form instead and link that - because those questions "live" on the target project, they are not copies.

This doesn't really fit your use-case anyway, but it's something to be aware of if someone wants to start putting those kinds of questions on the forms - then it's best to use the "group member question" form instead and link that - because those questions "live" on the target project, they are not copies.

This doesn't really fit your use-case anyway, but it's something to be aware of if someone wants to start putting those kinds of questions on the forms - then it's best to use the "group member question" form instead and link that - because those questions "live" on the target project, they are not copies.

2021-12-02 20:59:14		 13:39  scoutnet  redmine  redmine  | That's really annoying because it's normal with csv files to add quotes around strings with possible delimiters (spaces, commas, semi-colons, etc) like "Employment status" since some csv interpretations separate columns on spaces, and also it means that there's no confusion if a group name (for example) contains a comma or semi-colon, since it's wrapped in quotes. A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.
2021-12-02 20:59:14		 13:39  scoutnet  redmine  redmine  | This is something PHP does automatically when exporting csv, so I'm going to have to do it manually, or "clean" away the quotes afterward :/

But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.

But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.

But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

2021-12-02 21:47:31		 13:39  scoutnet  redmine  redmine  | That's really annoying because it's normal with csv files to add quotes around strings with possible delimiters (spaces, commas, semi-colons, etc) like "Employment status" since some csv interpretations separate columns on spaces, and also it means that there's no confusion if a group name (for example) contains a comma or semi-colon, since it's wrapped in quotes. A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.
2021-12-02 21:47:31		 13:39  scoutnet  redmine  redmine  | This is something PHP does automatically when exporting csv, so I'm going to have to do it manually, or "clean" away the quotes afterward :/

But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

2021-12-02 23:55:02		 19:11  scoutnet  redmine  redmine  | 1. Should it be all members (15+) in every file? Restricted to main org I guess? Or just those with roles/group memberships/etc?
2021-12-02 23:55:03		 19:11  scoutnet  redmine  redmine  | 2. Will they handle inactive/removed members by their absence in the file (related to point 1) - does this mean an accidental empty file upload deletes everyone? What are the consequences of that?

A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.

A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.

But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

A lot of your group names contain commas, which is fortunately not a problem since this importer uses semi-colons (;) but all it would take is one group to add a semi colon to their name and this whole file breaks.

But it does make me wonder what kind of importer they are using if they can't handle "standard" csv files :( Probably something they have written themselves which just separates between the semi-colons, so they don't want the quotation marks because they get read as part of the value...

I have a machine with no public interface connected, so the plan is to use a proxy to reach machines outside the internal network.

2021-12-03 20:17:59		 18:45  libera  clojure  selfsymme…  Most problems involve reading an input and computing some property efficiently.
2021-12-03 20:17:59		 18:45  libera  clojure  selfsymme…  So the spine of my solution is to have a recursive function with recur for tail-recursion-checking.
2021-12-03 20:18:00		 18:46  libera  clojure  selfsymme…  The first parameter is the input being consumed (sometimes after some postprocessing), and the rest of the parameters are accumulators.
