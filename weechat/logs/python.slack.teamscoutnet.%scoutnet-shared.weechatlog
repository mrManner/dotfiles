2021-05-19 19:17:14	mrmanner	Nothing fancy needed, as long as it can log in

2021-10-12 20:00:02	PetterSandholdt(Link√∂ping)*	Hi
2021-10-12 20:00:02	                           	Is there a way to find out what the id (that i call registration_id bellow)  is?
2021-10-12 20:00:02	                           	I have an activity with an id and a form with a form_id and want to link to the view of the responses, which has the url:
2021-10-12 20:00:02	                           	https://scoutnet.se/activities/<activity_id>/registration_summary/for/<registration_id>/form/<form_id>
2021-10-12 20:00:02	                           	I can get all the responses using the url bellow, but is it possible to figure out the registration_id as well? (why is it not the member_id?)
2021-10-12 20:00:02	                           	https://scoutnet.se/api/project/get/participants?id=<activity_id>&key=<key>
2021-10-12 22:03:43	russ	[eff] Ah I see the participant list indexes by member number... Cleanest is probably to change the URL to use member numbers then - it's much more common than user ID in URLs.
2021-10-12 22:06:03	russ	[eff] Although that said... It seems a lot of the project/activity URLs do use user ID... For now maybe it's best just to add it as a value in the get/participants response for now
