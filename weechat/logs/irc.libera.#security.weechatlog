2021-10-13 21:23:36	mathu	ajak: because gadgets end in returns? i don't see how new frames would be created for the ROP gadgets
2021-10-13 21:23:58	mathu	you overwrite a return address to initiate the ROP chain, but you can't generate new call instructions or whatever
2021-10-13 21:24:38	ajak	you can't generate new call instructions yes, and new frames won't be created, no
2021-10-13 21:25:05	mathu	so, when each gadget runs its ret instruction, the stack pointer gets moved
2021-10-13 21:25:14	mathu	right?
2021-10-13 21:25:33	ajak	as i understand it when you get control of the return address you jmp (or whatever) into the address at the return address, then when that code ret's it ret's to the next pointer on the stack

2021-10-13 21:27:09	mathu	doesn't ret move the stack pointer itself though?
2021-10-13 21:27:14	ajak	well, to try to avoid mincing words, what RET does is pop the address at the top of the stack and jmp to it
2021-10-13 21:27:23	ajak	sounds right
2021-10-13 21:27:57	mathu	i'm aching for lack of an ability to quickly playground this like most of my other programming questions :v

2021-10-13 21:30:30	ajak	yes
2021-10-13 21:30:32	ajak	i have used pwndbg
2021-10-13 21:31:56	mathu	so i write my first gadget's address to the stack, and then when my current function returns, i ret and jump to the gadget. my gadget will presumably pop its own locals off the stack and then ret, which requires that i've written another gadget's return address to an earlier location in the stack depending on how much my first gadget pops. i might be able to choose gadgets that call to create more stack
2021-10-13 21:32:02	mathu	frames if... they also contain bugs to let me overwrite the return addresses they push? so i think there has to be a depth limit to ROP chains based on how many stack frames deep you were at the start

2021-10-13 21:32:25	mathu	and setting up your ROP chains is a destructive operation; you have to overwrite parts of previous stack frames to set up. right?

2021-10-13 21:33:32	ajak	sometimes you can be lucky and set things back up so that the program continues but it's rarely a real concern

2021-10-13 21:36:40	mathu	gotcha. a page online suggested ROP was good not just because it works around DEP but because it avoids smashing the stack, and i just couldn't think of how that could be possible
2021-10-13 21:36:47	mathu	looks like i was right :)
2021-10-13 21:36:50	mathu	thanks for confirming!
2021-10-13 21:37:16	ajak	well i'm a moron
2021-10-13 21:37:57	ajak	maybe i'm wrong, but i'd think that any overflow can destroy things that something else might expect to be there

On those I've  written somewhat about Russian espionage. You may rule that as apolitical if you want.

2021-10-30 17:22:46	Joanna	What is Finlandisation ?
2021-10-30 17:22:53	ww86	This can be a factor in how this case has progressed. I've had 2 hypotheses related to why the Russians started to mess with me in the first place, and I don't know if either of them is correct. The first one is that it was related to my blog, and the second is that it has to do with my brother, who is in a fairly influential position.
2021-10-30 17:23:36	ajak	so you're hypothesizing why the russians have gone after you (and your mp3s)
2021-10-30 17:23:42	ajak	do you have evidence that it actually is russia?
2021-10-30 17:24:01	ww86	Finladisation, or "Finlandzierung", the word comes from German. It refers to the political state of our country during the Cold War, in which the KGB got a major grip from the political life of our country. This is characterized by a situation, where politicians and people elsewhere in the society, were engaging in self-censorship and abstained
2021-10-30 17:24:02	ww86	from being critical of the Soviet Union.
2021-10-30 17:24:54	ww86	Ajak, other than there being one Estonian-Russian guy who told me in person that "We are going to kill you" and by deductive reasoning based on circumstantial factors - Such that the only source of such influence in our society can be Russia.

2021-10-30 17:27:06	tomreyn	what's generally known in europe is that finland is rather worried about the influence russia has on the country, and, as it seems, for good reasons. generally, russia is doing an info war on europe since putin got angry about the nato's continued progress towards the east, and into former UdSSR countries.
2021-10-30 17:27:09	ajak	they might not like it sure but there are bigger fish to care about than some guy that wrote something in finland

Can we just pretend or consider it as a thought-experiment, from the perspective, "assuming it was true that I was trolled by the Russians, then..." ... What could I do in that

2021-10-30 17:29:50	Joanna	ww86: if you have people in person threatening to kill you that is a much bigger problem than garbled mp3 files I think..
2021-10-30 17:30:06	ajak	state sponsored hackers have better things to do than "troll" people
2021-10-30 17:30:36	ajak	especially if state agents have come into physical contact with you, like Joanna says
2021-10-30 17:30:39	ww86	Joanna, that event is more complicated than what I let you know about it. But it still goes into this case, and I have told the Finnish counter-intelligence about this incident. I suspect they can't do anything about it, and so far apparently haven't.
2021-10-30 17:30:53	ajak	they wouldn't tell you if they did :p

2021-10-30 17:32:48	Joanna	What does mp3 file sound like and does it happen to all mp3 files the same ?
2021-10-30 17:34:31	ww86	The edits are such that if you take the transcript of what is said, it is intact. Like if I download a lecture, and write down each word and speaker, none of those things have changed. But instead it's things like how the people in the file are saying things, such as laborious breathing sounds, smacking sounds of the mouth, over-pronouncing some
2021-10-30 17:34:32	ww86	sounds like the "s" or things of that sort. There's probably a reason for doing it in that particular manner.
2021-10-30 17:35:11	ww86	...My guess is that for someone to look into it, they'd need to be able to do more than look at such a transcript. Which would take time and resources.
2021-10-30 17:35:59	ww86	The overall result is regardless, that they're annoying to listen to. And it's kind of difficult to put your finger on what it is exactly that's wrong with them, since they're things of that sort.
2021-10-30 17:36:12	Joanna	Are the extra sounds added or the original sounds distorted do you think?
2021-10-30 17:36:47	ww86	I think it's original sounds distorted, more likely anyway. It's hard to tell for sure if something like that is extra or not.

They appointed two directors, Erich Mielke and Markus Wolf to head the STASI, both of whom were presumably on NKVD payroll before the appointment. Additionally there were liaison officers of the  (later) KGB

2021-12-01 23:40:05	ajak	when you're choosing a distribution based on its security you're not choosing which one has more secure configuration by default; you're choosing which one has a better security posture
2021-12-01 23:41:29	ajak	imo they're both the kinds of distros to hold on to ancient software and patch into oblivion (and that can lead to unique vulnerabilities that aren't in other distros)

2021-12-02 06:36:54	Hash	I give this analogy/argument quite often and it makes sense to people.
2021-12-02 06:37:09	Hash	The best defense in nature is camoflague. Concealment.
2021-12-02 06:37:25	Hash	To hide in plain sight. If predetors cannot even tell you're there, they can't do anything.
2021-12-02 06:37:44	Hash	Obviously it wont' deter a targeted attack, but bots looking for 22 open, it will absolutely thwart that.
2021-12-02 06:37:49	Seirdy	yes but port scanning is like the first thing an attacker will do if they notice
2021-12-02 06:37:58	Hash	So obscurity isn't security sure. But it does add to it and it's a large part of it.
2021-12-02 06:38:44	Seirdy	port scanning is kind of standard practice even for bots. service enumeration and scanning comes first, then exploitation.
2021-12-02 06:38:54	Hash	Correct
2021-12-02 06:39:00	Hash	Use port knocking or firewall.
2021-12-02 06:39:09	Hash	Change port too, why not. Doesn't make my life harder.
2021-12-02 06:39:22	Hash	But it does lessen the noise in logs.
2021-12-02 06:39:29	Seirdy	so you shouldn't count on it for anything. do it if you feel like but don't tell yourself that you're doing anything more than buying time.
2021-12-02 06:40:01	Hash	I as a man of science cannot buy into blanket statements like that.
2021-12-02 06:40:01	Seirdy	we already have better solutions out there
2021-12-02 06:40:19	Hash	Every since I started adding obscurity to my seucirty models, I've noticed a fraction of the noise I used to get in my logs.
2021-12-02 06:40:44	Hash	Once again, it should not be relied upon as a sole means of security.
2021-12-02 06:41:15	Seirdy	yes they'll clean out the low hanging fruit. so will more effective solutions. the difference is that an actual threat will just hop over the half-measures like they aren't even there.
2021-12-02 06:41:18	Hash	It adds and embellishes. It deters some people. What %, we can't say.
2021-12-02 06:41:31	Hash	Seirdy | yes they'll clean out the low hanging fruit <- That!
2021-12-02 06:41:36	Hash	You found the words for me!
2021-12-02 06:41:38	Hash	:)
2021-12-02 06:41:59	Hash	You're right.
2021-12-02 06:42:29	Hash	It is also a good idea to give them less targets. If someone is determined, you can't really stop that. But just passserbys, you want to hide from them.
2021-12-02 06:42:34	Seirdy	you can either clear the low hanging fruit without actually solving the problem, or just fix the problem. if the obscurity makes any meaningful difference it means that you haven't locked things down
2021-12-02 06:42:37	Hash	You don't want to be visible to everyone.
2021-12-02 06:42:49	Hash	Even innature camoflauge only works against certain perdators and not all predators.
2021-12-02 06:43:02	Hash	We can see through a lot of camoflauge designed for other predators.
2021-12-02 06:43:12	Hash	Likewise in security.
2021-12-02 06:43:28	Seirdy	look at it this way: you can either nuke a fort, nuke a fort then drop a grenade, or just drop a grenade. why would you even bother with a grenade when you have the nuke? sure it'll take care of low-hanging fruit, but *why*?
2021-12-02 06:43:31	Hash	You hide from some predators, but not all. And the ones you do hide from, is less nuisance. So it's a good thing.
2021-12-02 06:43:58	Seirdy	security isn't a game of predator and prey. we're talking about literal machines here.
2021-12-02 06:44:04	Hash	I'm not sure I can agree to that analogy.
2021-12-02 06:44:12	Hash	Nukes are bad due to fallout and health reasons.

2021-12-02 06:44:33	Hash	Perhaps a different analogy would be more useful.
2021-12-02 06:44:44	Seirdy	look you know what i mean. you either solve the problem or you just delay solving it.
2021-12-02 06:45:00	Seirdy	if you lock down your ssh configs it won't matter that everyone can see your port
2021-12-02 06:45:04	Hash	I advise sprinkling obscuity into your security model.
2021-12-02 06:45:10	Hash	It helps.
2021-12-02 06:45:28	CoJaBo	Seirdy: If the nuke's a dud, you might still get a kill with the grenade :P
2021-12-02 06:45:35	Seirdy	i'd only advise changing your port because if you notice that doing so makes a significant difference, you'd know you've failed
2021-12-02 06:45:38	Hash	CoJaBo: also excellent point.
2021-12-02 06:45:51	CoJaBo	Offense in depth.
2021-12-02 06:46:17	Hash	Seirdy: right now my server has 443/80/25 open. And 25 doesn't advertise AUTH.
2021-12-02 06:46:29	Hash	22 isn't visible to anyonle.
2021-12-02 06:46:44	Hash	Runa  -p1-65536 and you still won't find anything.
2021-12-02 06:46:50	Hash	Use port knockking or firewalls.
2021-12-02 06:47:00	Hash	Try not to leave 22 open unless you want needlessly huge logs.
2021-12-02 06:47:12	Hash	Also, Personal Computing.
2021-12-02 06:47:19	Hash	Personal. Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.
2021-12-02 06:48:22	Hash	The only noise I have now is in exim logs, people trying the AUTH command when it's not advertised, to protocol errors.
2021-12-02 06:48:44	Hash	No way to kill SMTP noise. Can kill all other noise but that damn SMTP wont' shut up. People won't stop! Haha
2021-12-02 06:49:19	Hash	They are trying to AUTH on 25 and AUTH is only advertised on SSL, not STARTLS even.
2021-12-02 06:49:29	Hash	STARTTLS is only for MTA to MTA communication.
2021-12-02 06:50:54	Seirdy	or you could just not log events you find useless.
2021-12-02 06:51:16	Seirdy	those bruteforce attempts are only an issue if they increase your load, since you shouldn't be bruteforceable
2021-12-02 06:51:29	Seirdy	and you're using fail2ban so that'll fix that
2021-12-02 06:51:54	Seirdy	what are you protecting yourself from?
2021-12-02 06:54:09	Seirdy	try bruteforcing yourself. it's a fun exercise. see what actually works.

2021-12-02 19:22:44	Seirdy	it's compatible with magic-wormhole too. looks like magic-wormhole's devs are doing a RIIR over at https://github.com/magic-wormhole/magic-wormhole.rs which I find odd since wormhole-william already works so well

2021-12-02 19:26:15	Seirdy	rudi_s: "bruteforcing yourself" means exactly what it sounds like: launching a brute-force attack against your own machines. we were discussing ways to harden a server's ssh configs to resist brute-force attacks and i disagreed with the merit of some methods; i suggested an experimental approach as an alternative to both of our speculations.
2021-12-02 19:28:09	rudi_s	Seirdy: I see, thanks. Personally I don't think brute force is really necessary as you can just configure it to withstand a possible brute-force. Also many issues won't be identified by an experiment and only be configuring the hosts securely.
2021-12-02 19:28:45	Seirdy	agreed, the reason i brought it up was to demonstrate that certain simple measures are sufficient.
2021-12-02 19:30:50	rudi_s	Yeah, that's true
2021-12-02 19:48:53	catbeard	just use ssh keys with a ssh certificate CA
2021-12-02 19:48:56	catbeard	e.g. smallstep.com
2021-12-02 19:49:12	catbeard	and disable password auth, disable remote root login
2021-12-02 19:51:14	MadCamel	or make sure the ssh private key is 2-factor secure - smartcard suggested - and allow remote root login. then remove the suid bit from all binaries on the remote machine. this reduces attack surface.
2021-12-02 19:57:29	Seirdy	yes disable passwords login, disable root login, enable 2fa. I'd personally rather use dnssec to store pubkeys: https://blog.cloudflare.com/flexible-secure-ssh-with-dnssec/

2021-12-02 20:38:15	MadCamel	yep. it's not like the service wouldn't be running anyway. and it's unlikely disabling root login would prevent any type of exploit.
2021-12-02 20:41:15	MadCamel	Just have to keep the key secure. Using sudo or su to get to root it's key+password on the remote system. Something you have, something you know. Root keys can meet that requirement as well. Just don't leave them sitting unencrypted in ssh-agent and use agent forwarding or anything silly..
2021-12-02 20:42:23	MadCamel	It's amazing the inertia that's behind a lot of bad/useless practices.

2021-12-03 00:27:19	catbeard	158.136.181.135.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer mail.rspamd.net.
2021-12-03 00:27:37	catbeard	i assume you were trying to trick us into blacklisting ourselves on a honeyport
2021-12-03 00:28:00	catbeard	or are you just trying to determine if it's only you that can't send datagrams to that UDP port with nc -u
2021-12-03 00:28:16	catbeard	i don't think you'd get confirmation with -z but i could be mistaken

2021-12-03 00:30:29	tmberg	catbeard: Nah. No trick. I would never do such a thing.
2021-12-03 00:30:31	catbeard	UDP isn't guaranteed to be delivered, but if you're having with a service on rspamd's mail server that you're actually using, you should probably get in touch with rspamd
2021-12-03 00:30:33	catbeard	;)
2021-12-03 00:31:08	tmberg	catbeard: I was told it was blocked by me.
2021-12-03 00:31:26	catbeard	could be an egress policy or upstream egress block
2021-12-03 00:32:19	catbeard	if they have no record it hitting, it's possible it didn't get sent fully, even if your system allowed outbound UDP on 11335, upstream might have an egress filter that needs exemption
2021-12-03 00:32:34	catbeard	either that or rspamd port or ip acl preventing you from sending traffic
2021-12-03 00:32:46	catbeard	on their mailserver
2021-12-03 00:33:48	tmberg	catbeard: Nah. All is fine now. ( Although I removed that perticular "thing" either way. )
2021-12-03 00:34:15	tmberg	nc -vz -u 135.181.136.158 11335
2021-12-03 00:34:20	tmberg	Works fine.
2021-12-03 00:34:39	tmberg	So..
2021-12-03 00:34:40	catbeard	that's the same command
2021-12-03 00:34:45	catbeard	just less verbosity
2021-12-03 00:34:59	tmberg	But nvm.
2021-12-03 00:35:06	catbeard	maybe temporary problem then
2021-12-03 00:35:09	tmberg	yes. But i installed ncat.
2021-12-03 00:35:24	catbeard	i like ncat better honestly because --ssl
2021-12-03 00:35:25	ilikeyou	chasing too much v is always trouble
2021-12-03 00:35:37	tmberg	And it worked.

2021-12-03 00:37:08	tmberg	Some timeout setting or so. But i do not like seeing errors. Im "allergic" to that. :-)
2021-12-03 00:37:28	catbeard	tmberg: ah, higher timeouts needed, probably a latency issue, check ping to that ip from your box doing the nc
2021-12-03 00:38:03	catbeard	maybe try a mtr then a regular traceroute as well
2021-12-03 00:38:18	catbeard	see if there's any discrepancies or repeated * * * lines
2021-12-03 00:38:37	tmberg	catbeard: Nah.

2021-12-03 07:02:08	betterOn1	hi.
2021-12-03 07:02:27	betterOn1	there are hundreds of hostname:port pairs to check if they are available or not
2021-12-03 07:03:07	betterOn1	if port is open or not.. is there any ready application to do this?
2021-12-03 07:04:06	catbeard	betterOn1: nmap, or if you don't want send traffic and just search by target info, shodan.io
2021-12-03 07:06:28	ajak	i think maybe masscan could work too
2021-12-03 07:06:33	ajak	if it's *really* a lot
2021-12-03 07:06:50	catbeard	or python's scanless module
2021-12-03 07:07:05	catbeard	ajak: ya but why massscan when shodan.io basically does that already
2021-12-03 07:07:20	catbeard	and you don't have to fire bullets, just 1 to another target
2021-12-03 07:07:35	catbeard	also private firehose for asn ❤
2021-12-03 07:08:15	catbeard	I have a module call Sensor that I use to extract open ports
2021-12-03 07:09:24	betterOn1	i'l check python's scanless module, because in fact, i need some more info about each connection and need to make some parsing on url
2021-12-03 07:09:39	betterOn1	thank you :)
2021-12-03 07:09:54	catbeard	still in dev so far but the basic idea - https://kopy.io/K0oFu#qjLbH5n9ivhFin
2021-12-03 07:09:54	websec	^ kopy
2021-12-03 07:10:30	dodo	betterOn1: more info?
2021-12-03 07:11:09	catbeard	however the caveats of relying on a proxied port scan should be obvious
2021-12-03 07:11:21	betterOn1	dodo: some url use subdomain and i need to get their ip number to report exactly as i want(in specific format)
2021-12-03 07:11:33	catbeard	but has the advantage of obscuring the origin of the scan
2021-12-03 07:12:25	dodo	betterOn1: domain-ip mapping is not necessarily 1:1
2021-12-03 07:13:55	betterOn1	it is required to prepare a report
2021-12-03 07:14:14	catbeard	betterOn1: sounds like just doing a hostname lookup / dig
2021-12-03 07:14:24	catbeard	maybe censys search for the CN
2021-12-03 07:17:02	catbeard	securitytrails a/cname history for it as a precaution for due diligence
2021-12-03 07:24:30	betterOn1	catbeard: thank you. sorry i'm on an online meeting.. i'll check them all :)
2021-12-03 07:29:41	betterOn1	dodo: i got what you mean right now :) they are all intranet hostnames, maybe there are a few hostnames resolve to multiple ip but they are 1:1 usually

2021-12-03 18:24:57	tesseract	what does companies that use rhel do? do they take compatible hardware and use it 10 years without changing it?
2021-12-03 18:25:31	tesseract	i learnt that rhel doesn't support major release update
2021-12-03 18:25:47	tesseract	so, they suck with it 10 years or they will reinstall it
2021-12-03 18:25:53	tesseract	anyone knows about this?
2021-12-03 18:29:09	ajak	redhat is famous for offering paid support for rhel too
2021-12-03 18:29:33	s1gyn	They do backports of security and bug fixes though
2021-12-03 18:29:37	tomreyn	a general statement will be difficult for anyone not working in the proper department at redhat. i (not redhat) would guess that many customers run the hardware until Redhat EOL, others will replace it once, or twice, during the lifetime.
2021-12-03 18:30:54	tesseract	tomreyn: but it will support only old hardware
2021-12-03 18:31:05	tomreyn	running outdated hardware can get quite expensive in terms of energy efficiency, so there will be some urge to replace it occasionally. less so with moore's law no longer applying as much.
2021-12-03 18:31:50	s1gyn	I've never heard of lack of support for server hardware being an issue
2021-12-03 18:32:08	s1gyn	just lack of latest version of <whatever>
2021-12-03 18:32:23	s1gyn	Maybe desktop
2021-12-03 18:32:59	tesseract	for example rhel 7 or 8 will support intel 13th gen hardware? i guess no
2021-12-03 18:33:01	tomreyn	i'm sure they take good care of covering most recent server hardware even with the old kernel versions
2021-12-03 18:33:33	s1gyn	You could ask on #rhel there are redhat employees on that channel
2021-12-03 18:34:08	tesseract	s1gyn: will do
2021-12-03 18:35:04	tomreyn	you could look into how / when they introduced epyc support, this will have been a major undertaking, not easily applied to old kernels, i guess
2021-12-03 18:35:39	tomreyn	but then, none of this is about security, or is it?
2021-12-03 18:35:49	 *	ajak points to topic
2021-12-03 18:35:53	ajak	offtopic is ok :P
2021-12-03 18:36:54	ajak	new processors are still on the same ISA so they should be at a minimum able to run the older binaries
2021-12-03 18:37:01	tesseract	i asked here because i thought people who works big companies here
