2021-10-16 12:58:55	dispersed	we should be grateful that people like Papi exist
2021-10-16 12:59:19	dispersed	they are proof of wisdom in the sense that without stupidity, wisdom would be pretty pointless
2021-10-16 12:59:53	dispersed	+ he likes cheeseburgers, which I share with him, rather would have 'em vegan cheese nowadays
2021-10-16 13:00:50	dispersed	+r makes sense if it works, but it does make it harder for a really casual user to join, because identifying isn't automatic in all clients
2021-10-16 13:01:21	dispersed	I wonder if Papi is a criminal with a botnet or some corrupt sysadmin at google who has access to too many machines
2021-10-16 13:01:55	@nb-ben	probably just has a vpn
2021-10-16 13:02:13	@nb-ben	anyway this is what most channels which experience this problem do
2021-10-16 13:02:18	dispersed	ouch, so collateral damage if anyone uses that same vpn
2021-10-16 13:02:33	@nb-ben	like, registered only and forward unregistered to a help channel
2021-10-16 13:03:28	dispersed	invite only could work if there was some kind of autoinvite, like reverse-forwarding
2021-10-16 13:03:33	dispersed	hmh, nope
2021-10-16 13:03:47	dispersed	when you say something out loud, you notice how dumb it is ,p
2021-10-16 13:04:12	dispersed	well anyway, a kind of whitelisting
2021-10-16 13:04:33	dispersed	you could whitelist people in normal times, but just temporarily not-auto-invite them in Papi times
2021-10-16 13:05:14	dispersed	I wonder if 'whitelist' is PC anymore, is there a better term
2021-10-16 13:05:22	@nb-ben	breaking the channel to deal with an individual kind of means they won
2021-10-16 13:07:10	dispersed	exactly, +r _slightly_ breaks it, unless it improves quality otherwise
2021-10-16 13:08:24	dispersed	moriarty had a weird way to improve quality, just randomly kick people 
2021-10-16 13:09:35	dispersed	ppl like papi could be directed to mental health services as well
2021-10-16 13:09:49	dispersed	dunno if that's insulting but
2021-10-16 13:10:00	dispersed	it is what it is
2021-10-16 13:10:29	dispersed	like, if he acts in a similar way in other areas of life, it's bound to suck for him as well
2021-10-16 13:10:55	dispersed	and if he invests with that attitude, he's probably not very successful either

2021-10-16 13:13:00	dispersed	and he's clearly seeking attention
2021-10-16 13:13:08	dispersed	basically needs a psychotherapist
2021-10-16 13:13:13	dispersed	or meds
2021-10-16 13:14:11	dispersed	there was a guy terrorizing a channel, where the teams was depression, he has borderline personality and was open about it
2021-10-16 13:14:19	dispersed	*theme not teams lol
2021-10-16 13:14:39	dispersed	he would join with multiple nicknames that would join their forces to annoy some helpless depressed person
2021-10-16 13:15:38	dispersed	multiple dark triad traits, sadistic, narcissistic, and able to act on it I suppose
2021-10-16 13:16:56	dispersed	sad fucks
2021-10-16 13:17:36	dispersed	papi could just be a maniac
2021-10-16 13:17:48	dispersed	he isn't _that_ evil, just persistent
2021-10-16 13:18:43	@nb-ben	I personally didn't have any issues with him while we were interacting besides the power games/insults with the ops, no idea about other stuff he's done before or why he was banned in the first place though
2021-10-16 13:20:15	dispersed	I didn't have a lot of problem with him either, he didn't target me, actually tried to somehow be friendly with me, but I noticed that if I try even slightest critique, he turns sour pretty quick
2021-10-16 13:20:29	dispersed	so he has traits that he's unable to adjust
2021-10-16 13:20:43	dispersed	like if you say "uh, could you calm down a bit" he'll just get worse and so on
2021-10-16 13:22:33	dispersed	e.g. I asked him how much he slept last night, he would reply basically that I shouldn't care
2021-10-16 13:22:41	dispersed	and tried to insult me about caring
2021-10-16 13:22:59	dispersed	I don't really care, I was just curious what kind of problem he has
2021-10-16 13:23:44	dispersed	maybe he's an alcoholic, that would explain a lot

2021-10-17 20:12:59	@apotheon	I wonder what it takes for someone to consider a software dev "educated" rather than "self-taught".  Is it okay if the person took one programming class and got a degree in art history?

2021-12-02 08:02:51	skipper	yes noob ly sir
2021-12-02 08:03:06	noobly	this is totally off topic, but my grandpa lived through the great depression and was telling me a crisis, which he won't live through, is on the horizon, snd he advised stocking up on seeds, preservable food, and land if i could afford it
2021-12-02 08:03:35	noobly	now I know there's supply chain issues, but my gut tells famine is problem of the past

2021-12-02 08:04:51	skipper	not sure
2021-12-02 08:05:07	noobly	has your certainty decreased in the last two years?

2021-12-02 08:08:27	skipper	noobly: I wont do it
2021-12-02 08:08:30	skipper	but you can try
2021-12-02 08:09:32	noobly	I've never done it either, but I completely rely on national or globalized supply chains to feed me
2021-12-02 08:09:59	noobly	Ive been under the impression that this risk is waning personally

2021-12-02 08:57:14	Inge	noobly: during wwII my grandpa grew tobacco plants in the back yard - since tobacco was universally desired it was easy to trade for anything else. Not sure what equates to that today. But I do note that much higher energy prices has an impact on production of fertilizers which has a huge impact on crop yields ...
2021-12-02 08:57:52	Inge	Most countries have really complex dependencies on international travel and imports of stuff we take for granted.
2021-12-02 09:12:49	noobly	Inge: when does it become appropriate to allocate funds to food?
2021-12-02 09:15:37	Inge	Heh. in Feb 2020 I was concerned about a possible disruption of supply chains, so I just bought a little more of dry and canned goods whenever I went to the store, so we had some buffer. But in reality it never got bad (except for a few days of toilet paper shortage, because people are stupid)
2021-12-02 09:17:35	Inge	I guess you need to look at your threat model. Like having food for a few weeks would offset a short term disturbance - but most people won't be that prepared, so either supply lines get restored or chaos within a week or two ... and if society crumbles, just stocking up canned food is not going to cut it
2021-12-02 09:17:40	nb-ben	if you're right about that one time out of 10, it's worth the 9 other times when you were wrong
2021-12-02 09:18:10	Inge	like a nuclear bunker migh help you survive the initial fallout, but then what?
2021-12-02 09:18:20	nb-ben	and if you buy canned food then you can eat over the year anyway
2021-12-02 09:18:48	Inge	yeah I slowly whittled down the extra flour / rice / canned goods etc.. that I had stocked up on
2021-12-02 09:18:57	nb-ben	Inge: do you play League of Legends?
2021-12-02 09:19:32	Inge	no
2021-12-02 09:19:43	nb-ben	Inge: in the first 4-5 minutes of the game, that's where you have the most agency, because everyone starts out at an equal level
2021-12-02 09:19:58	Inge	I know starcraft better - but it is kind of similar I guess
2021-12-02 09:20:09	nb-ben	Inge: if you do bad within that time-frame, then you're at a disadvantage for the rest of the game
2021-12-02 09:20:43	nb-ben	Inge: but if you took the opportunity within these few minutes to get a lead, then you have more opportunity later to keep that lead
2021-12-02 09:21:19	Inge	sure, if any kind of lead makes sense after surviving the initial event :D
2021-12-02 09:21:22	nb-ben	Inge: just because you can't predict how things will go after the shortages doesn't mean that there isn't a significant importance to prepare for the thing you can prepare for
2021-12-02 09:21:56	nb-ben	Inge: like, if you're really hungry and weak after a few weeks of shortages, whatever comes next will be a lot harder to deal with
2021-12-02 09:22:04	Inge	oh absolutely
2021-12-02 09:22:32	Inge	I see our govt wants all households to have self sufficiency for 3 days. Heh. not much compared to what e.g. many Americans prepare for
2021-12-02 09:23:03	nb-ben	also I think investing into a bunker and everything depends on a person's situation
2021-12-02 09:23:51	nb-ben	I mean, imagine that you have more than enough money to retire and do everything you want to do, maybe accumulating even more money doesn't make much sense to you than it does to build that underground bunker
2021-12-02 09:24:10	Inge	prepper attitudes seem to often neglect the power of a community in common preparation. 
2021-12-02 09:25:41	nb-ben	involving more brains in things increases the surface for failure and manipulation and such
2021-12-02 09:26:17	nb-ben	you can always choose to share, but you can't unshare without consequences

2021-12-03 04:12:19	+DrFockIt	LibertyDillo: ^ news.bitcoin.com: ''Wolf of Wall Street' Jordan Belfort Warns About Investing in Dogecoin and Shiba Inu Cryptocurrencies – News Bitcoin News'
2021-12-03 04:21:07	db	so glad we were warned
2021-12-03 04:22:29	db	without reading the article, I wonder what he thinks about Bitcoin, and whether it is fundamentally different from DOGE and SHIB?
2021-12-03 04:28:25	LibertyDillo	Have you seen the movie The Wolf Of Wall Street with Di Caprio?
2021-12-03 04:28:40	LibertyDillo	Not sure I'd take his advice either ;)
2021-12-03 04:38:58	db	yes, but it's a movie. 
2021-12-03 04:39:20	LibertyDillo	true
2021-12-03 04:40:08	LibertyDillo	perhaps a famous fraudster is giving good advice, who knows
2021-12-03 04:49:34	db	I guess a scammer knows when he sees a scam, no?
2021-12-03 05:19:11	@apotheon	I think that he probably just sees the same thing most mainstream Wall Street people see when they look at something like Dogecoin.
2021-12-03 05:21:54	db	he's probably missing the "intrinsic value", although I for one don't really understand the relevance of the "intrinsic value" of, say, GME, or TSLA (is that company *really worth that much, intrinsically?*)
2021-12-03 05:22:45	db	I mean does it even matter. people are throwing their money at it, that's what counts.
2021-12-03 05:22:59	db	will it ever change?

2021-12-03 06:44:56	db	you don't need a local girl to move to thailand. and once you're here you can just use tinder.
2021-12-03 06:45:15	skipper	tinder useful?
2021-12-03 06:45:34	db	I met my wife on tinder

2021-12-03 08:13:08	disperse1	so the movie character on coke is a parody
2021-12-03 08:15:15	dispersed	good tip about moving to thailand, too bad I found my gf in real life, didn't use tinder out of some kind of aversion towards the "format" so to speak
2021-12-03 08:16:06	dispersed	and there is a somewhat negligible chance I would have even liked the person on tinder to be honest
2021-12-03 08:16:12	dispersed	maybe if they wrote really well
2021-12-03 08:16:44	dispersed	would be interesting to study whether people's actual matches would be on tinder, if someone could think of a study pan
2021-12-03 08:16:47	dispersed	plan
2021-12-03 08:17:03	dispersed	(she did use tinder but didn't find a good match there either)
2021-12-03 08:19:18	db	yeah well I would usually go straight to "let's meet over a beer", and not chat much.
2021-12-03 08:20:12	db	I met multiple alcoholics that way.
2021-12-03 08:20:14	db	:D
2021-12-03 08:49:42	dispersed	would be dangerous for me, those types (unstable etc.) see me as an easy victim
2021-12-03 08:50:08	dispersed	because I'm not a white knight or whatever, but they think if you scratch the surface, you could find one
2021-12-03 08:50:30	dispersed	and then just never stop mind fucking ever worse
2021-12-03 08:53:42	dispersed	people's close, long-term relations tend to be over 90% positive etc., but online you have so many potentially bad ones you need to be conservative
2021-12-03 08:54:08	dispersed	they should teach in schools that people are social predators
